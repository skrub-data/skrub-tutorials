Outliers can dramatically\naffect the centering and scaling of the entire dataset, causing the scaled inliers\nto be compressed into a narrow range.\n\nConsider this example:\n\n::: {#95860843 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom helpers import (\n    generate_data_with_outliers,\n    plot_feature_with_outliers\n)\n\nvalues = generate_data_with_outliers()\n\nplot_feature_with_outliers(values)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](05_feat_eng_numerical_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){width=587 height=395}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this case, most of the values are in the range `[-2, 2]`, but there are some \nlarge outliers in the range `[-40, 40]` that can cause issues when the feature \nneeds to be scaled. \n\n\n### Regular scalers and their limitations\n\nThe **StandardScaler** computes mean and standard deviation across all values.\nWith outliers present, these statistics become unreliable, and the scaling factor\ncan become too small, squashing inlier values.\n\nThe **RobustScaler** uses quantiles (typically the 25th and 75th percentiles)\ninstead of mean/std, which makes it more resistant to outliers. However, it\ndoesn't bound the output values, so extreme outliers can still have very large\nscaled values.\n\n## SquashingScaler: A robust solution\n\nThe `SquashingScaler` combines robust centering with smooth clipping to handle\noutliers effectively.\n\nIt works as following:\n\n- It centers the median to 0, then it scales values using quantile-based statistics.\n- It fills constant columns with 0s.\n- It applies a smooth squashing function:\n$x_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{z}{\\sqrt{1 + (z/B)^2}}$\n- It constrains all values to the range\n$[-\\texttt{max\\_absolute\\_value}, \\texttt{max\\_absolute\\_value}]$ (default: 3)\n- Infinite values are mapped to the corresponding boundaries.\n- NaN values are kept unchanged.\n\n### Advantages and disadvantages of `SquashingScaler`\nThe `SquashingScaler` has various advantages over traditional scalers: \n\n- It is **outlier-resistant**: Outliers don't affect inlier scaling, unlike the\n`StandardScaler`.\n- It has **bounded output**: All values stay in a predictable range, ideal for \nneural networks and linear models.\n- It **handles edge cases**: The scaler works with infinite values and constant \ncolumns.\n- It **preserves missing data**: NaN values are kept unchanged. \n\nA disadvantage of the `SquashingScaler` is that it is **non-invertible**: \nThe soft clipping function is smooth but cannot be exactly inverted. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhen compared on data with outliers:\n\n- **StandardScaler** compresses inliers due to large scaling factors\n- **RobustScaler** preserves relative scales but allows extreme outlier values\n- **SquashingScaler** keeps inliers in a reasonable range while smoothly bounding\nall values\n\nIf we plot the impact of each scaler on the result, this is what we can see: \n\n::: {#3bedf600 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom helpers import scale_feature_and_plot\nscale_feature_and_plot(values)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](05_feat_eng_numerical_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){width=815 height=491}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
