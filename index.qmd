# Introduction to the course
This is the website for the Inria Academy
[course](https://www.inria-academy.fr/formation/skrub-like-a-pro-clean-prepare-and-transform-your-data-faster/)
on the [skrub package](https://skrub-data.org/stable/): it contains all the material
used for the course, including the datasets and exercises used during the session.

## Beta warning
If you are reading this, then you will be attending the **Beta version** of this 
course. As a **Beta version**, this is not the final version of the course and 
it will be tweaked according to the feedback provided after the beta session. 

Both the presentation and the content of the book are liable to be changed based
on feedback. 
:::

## Structure of the course
The course covers the main features of skrub, from data exploration to pipeline 
construction. Note that the skrub Data Ops are not covered in this course. 

Each chapter includes a section that describes how a specific feature may assist
in building a machine learning pipeline, along with practical code examples. 

Some chapters include exercises for the participants to work on with the assistance
of the instructure. Exercises can be run in the provided Jupyter notebooks. 

The content of the book is split in sections, and each section includes a "final 
quiz" that covers the subjects covered up to that point. 



# Prepration and setup


First of all, clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub-tutorials/tree/main) 
of this book to have access to the exercises. In a future version, Jupyterlite 
will be made available. 

## Setting up a local environment

:::  {.callout-important}
## Navigating the repository
Depending on how you launch the instance of Jupyter lab, you might start it in 
the root folder. 

All notebooks used in the course are found in `content/notebooks`.

### Using pixi
The easiest way to set up the environment is by installing and
using [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/). Follow the platform-specific 
instructions in the link to install pixi, then open a terminal window. 

Run 
```sh
pixi install
```
to create the environment, followed by 

```sh
pixi run lab
``` 
to start a Jupyter lab instance. 

### Using conda
An `environment.yaml` file is provided to create a conda environment. 

Create and activate the environment with

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate skrub-tutorial
```

Then, start a jupyter lab instance:

```sh
jupyter lab
```

### Using `uv`
Create the environment using `pyproject.toml` as the requirement file. 

```sh
uv venv 
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

Activate the environment that was created in the folder. 
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Start the Jupyter lab instance: 
```sh
jupyter lab
```


### Using `pip`
Create the and activate the environment:

```sh
python -m venv skrub-tutorial
source skrub-tutorial/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
