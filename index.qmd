This website contains the material used for the Inria Academy course on the
[skrub package](https://skrub-data.org/stable/). 

Each chapter of the book includes a theoretical section that describes a specific
aspect of the library, and, if appropriate, an exercise to evaluate the theory. 

Quiz sections split the major sections of the course. 

## Prepration and setup
The easiest way to work with the notebooks provided here is by installing and
using [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/).

Then, it is possible to run

```sh
pixi install
```
to create the environment, followed by 

```sh
pixi run jupyter lab
``` 
to start a jupyter lab instance. 

### With conda
An `environment.yaml` file is provided to create a conda environment. 

Create and activate the environment with

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate skrub-tutorial
```

Then, start a jupyter lab instance:

```sh
jupyter lab
```


### With `uv`

```sh
uv venv 
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```
