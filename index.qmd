# Introduction to the course
This is the website for the 
[Inria Academy course](https://www.inria-academy.fr/formation/skrub-like-a-pro-clean-prepare-and-transform-your-data-faster/)
on the [skrub package](https://skrub-data.org/stable/): it contains all the material
used for the course, including the datasets and exercises used during the session.

## 💻 Exercises
Hands-on Jupyter notebooks: [Browse Exercises](content/exercises/)

## Structure of the course
The course covers the main features of skrub, from data exploration to pipeline 
construction, with the notable exclusion of the Data Ops.

Each chapter includes a section that describes how a specific feature may assist
in building a machine learning pipeline, along with practical code examples. 

Some chapters include exercises for participants to work with the explained features.
These exercises are made available in `content/exercises`, as well as at the end
of the respective lesson in `content/notebooks`. 

The content of the book is split in sections, and each section includes a "final 
quiz" that covers the subjects covered up to that point. 

# Prepration and setup
First of all, clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub-tutorials/tree/main) 
of this book to have access to the exercises. In a future version, Jupyterlite 
support will be added.

## Setting up a local environment

:::  {.callout-important}
## Navigating the repository
Depending on how you launch the instance of Jupyter lab, you might start it in 
the root folder. 

All notebooks used in the course are found in `content/notebooks`, while the 
exercises are in `content/exercises`.

### Using pixi
The easiest way to set up the environment is by installing and
using [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/). Follow the platform-specific 
instructions in the link to install pixi, then open a terminal window in the 
folder of the repository you cloned.

Run 
```sh
pixi install
```
to create the environment, followed by 

```sh
pixi run lab
``` 
to start a Jupyter lab instance. 

### Using `pip`
Create the and activate the environment:

```sh
python -m venv skrub-tutorial
source skrub-tutorial/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the Jupyter lab instance: 
```sh
jupyter lab
```

### Using conda
An `environment.yaml` file is provided to create a conda environment. 

Create and activate the environment with

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate skrub-tutorial
```

Then, start a jupyter lab instance:

```sh
jupyter lab
```

### Using `uv`
Create the environment using `pyproject.toml` as the requirement file. 

```sh
uv venv 
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

Activate the environment that was created in the folder. 
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Start the Jupyter lab instance: 
```sh
jupyter lab
```
