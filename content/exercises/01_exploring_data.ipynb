    "## Answers\n",
    "- What's the size of the dataframe? (columns and rows)\n",
    "    - 9228 rows × 8 columns\n",
    "- How many columns have object/numerical/datetime\n",
    "    - No datetime columns, one integer column (`year_first_hired`), all other columns\n",
    "    are objects. \n",
    "- Are there columns with a large number of missing values?\n",
    "    - No, only the `gender` column contains a small fraction (0.2%) of missing\n",
    "    values.\n",
    "- Are there columns that have a high cardinality?\n",
    "    - Yes, `division`, `employee_position_title`, `date_first_hired` have a \n",
    "    cardinality larger than 40. \n",
    "- Were datetime columns parsed correctly?\n",
    "    - No, the `date_first_hired` column has dtype Object. \n",
    "- Which columns have outliers?\n",
    "    - No columns seem to include outliers. \n",
    "- Which columns have an imbalanced distribution?\n",
    "    - `assignment_category` has an unbalanced distribution. \n",
    "- Which columns are strongly correlated with each other?\n",
    "    - `department` and `department_name` have a Cramer's V of 1, so they are \n",
    "    very strongly correlated. "
