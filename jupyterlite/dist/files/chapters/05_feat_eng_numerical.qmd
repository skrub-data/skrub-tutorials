Now that we can apply selections to any column we want thanks to `ApplyToCols` and
the selectors, it is time to s


1. Numerical features with outliers
2. Regular scalers
3. SquashingScaler
    - SquashingScaler can't invert the transformation


## Exercise: comparing scalers
Scale the following data with the scikit-learn StandardScaler and RobustScaler,
and then with the SquashingScaler.

Answer the following questions:
- Mean/std of the transformed data
- Max/min of the transformed data
- Mean/std of the inliers (use provided iqr function)
