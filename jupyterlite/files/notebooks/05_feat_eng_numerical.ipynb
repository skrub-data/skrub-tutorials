    "\n",
    "When dealing with numerical features that contain outliers (including infinite\n",
    "values), standard scaling methods can be problematic. Outliers can dramatically\n",
    "affect the centering and scaling of the entire dataset, causing the scaled inliers\n",

    "In this case, most of the values are in the range `[-2, 2]`, but there are some \n",
    "large outliers in the range `[-40, 40]` that can cause issues when the feature \n",
    "needs to be scaled. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular scalers and their limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The **StandardScaler** computes mean and standard deviation across all values.\n",
    "With outliers present, these statistics become unreliable, and the scaling factor\n",
    "can become too small, squashing inlier values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **RobustScaler** uses quantiles (typically the 25th and 75th percentiles)\n",
    "instead of mean/std, which makes it more resistant to outliers. However, it\n",
    "doesn't bound the output values, so extreme outliers can still have very large\n",
    "scaled values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SquashingScaler: A robust solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SquashingScaler` combines robust centering with smooth clipping to handle\n",
    "outliers effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It centers the median to 0, then it scales values using quantile-based statistics.\n",
    "- It fills constant columns with 0s.\n",
    "- It applies a smooth squashing function:\n",
    "$x_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{z}{\\sqrt{1 + (z/B)^2}}$\n",
    "- It constrains all values to the range\n",
    "$[-\\texttt{max\\_absolute\\_value}, \\texttt{max\\_absolute\\_value}]$ (default: 3)\n",
    "- Infinite values are mapped to the corresponding boundaries.\n",
    "- NaN values are kept unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and disadvantages of `SquashingScaler`\n",
    "The `SquashingScaler` has various advantages over traditional scalers: \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is **outlier-resistant**: Outliers don't affect inlier scaling, unlike the\n",
    "`StandardScaler`.\n",
    "- It has **bounded output**: All values stay in a predictable range, ideal for \n",
    "neural networks and linear models.\n",
    "- It **handles edge cases**: The scaler works with infinite values and constant \n",
    "columns.\n",
    "- It **preserves missing data**: NaN values are kept unchanged. \n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage of the `SquashingScaler` is that it is **non-invertible**: \n",
    "The soft clipping function is smooth but cannot be exactly inverted. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "When compared on data with outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **StandardScaler** compresses inliers due to large scaling factors\n",
    "- **RobustScaler** preserves relative scales but allows extreme outlier values\n",
    "- **SquashingScaler** keeps inliers in a reasonable range while smoothly bounding\n",
    "all values\n",
