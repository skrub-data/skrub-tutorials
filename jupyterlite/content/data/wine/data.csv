Italy,"Coffee bean, leather and tobacco tones are surrounded by delicate aromas of wild berry, violet and spice. The tannins are tight and bone dry, making for a good pairing with cheese fondue.",Braja Riserva,87,,Piedmont,Roero,,Nebbiolo,Deltetto
Portugal,"Bottled in June 2009, nearly four years after harvest, this is a limited production wine. It has great structure, tannin and beautiful ripe fruits. With a perfumed black-currant character, it is ready to drink now, but its tannins suggest aging potential.",Quinta do Mourão Rio Bom Colheita,91,25.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Mário Braga
Chile,"Dusty, mild red fruit aromas bring hints of flowers, sucking candy and vanilla cream. The palate is bouncy, with lively but herbal raspberry and plum flavors. Finishes dry enough, with touches of vanilla, spice and bramble.",Reserva,84,10.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Merlot,Santa Carolina
US,"The most massive, dense and ageworthy of all the Sparkman reds, this Kingpin Cabernet is a barrel selection of the darkest, deepest wines in the cellar. Almost pure cassis fruit is matched to a firm, steely spine. Tannins are strong but not heavy, and the aging in two thirds new wood has not turned the wine terribly oaky. Hints of rock, tobacco and earth promise more flavor development over the next decade.",Kingpin,92,56.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sparkman
US,"Very much right-bank Bordeaux, with rich aromas of damp humus and tobacco. Then it turns smooth and plush in the mouth with a degree of ripeness that's decidedly New World. Finishes with a touch of toasty oak and decent acidity, but not much tannin. Drink over the next few years.",Sogno,88,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Di Stefano
US,"If this Syrah was from Napa, or even Sonoma, it would cost a lot more. It's really good, with fine tannins framing delicious, complex flavors of ripe berries, cured meats, peppery spices and smoky sandalwood. Sophisticated and elegant, it's worth a special search. Only 476 cases were produced.",,92,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah,Falcone
Austria,"A blend of local grapes (Zierfandler and Rotgipfler) this is impressive. Rich, perfumed, its fragrant fruits a medley of mulberry, pear and spiced apple. The acidity cuts right through, giving a wine that is both very ripe, balanced and finely textured. Screwcap.",Schell Mann in Gumpoldskirchen,92,24.0,Thermenregion,,,Austrian white blend,Loimer
France,"Relatively closed up at this stage, not giving much, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in five years—it will be magnificent.",Genevrières Premier Cru,94,102.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Morey-Blanc

US,"Riverbench's regular estate Pinot Noir, as opposed to their excellent Mesa reserve, has struggled over the years, and this '09 continues that pattern. It's elegantly structured, but somewhat underripe, with an asparagus edge to the raspberries, cherries and sweet oak.",Estate,86,28.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Riverbench

US,"This is the richest of Diatom's 2009 unoaked Chards. It's wildly expressive in tangerines, white truffles and honey, braced with a pleasing minerality. The alcohol is quite high, but an integral part of the wine's oily, glyceriney mouthfeel.",Huber Vineyard,94,48.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Diatom
US,"Still sorting itself out, it matches tart cranberry fruit to an astringent, tannic finish with highlights of espresso. More time in bottle may soften up some of the rough edges.",Runway,87,18.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Airfield Estates

US,"The thinking with this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend seems to have been, if ripeness is good, then superripeness is better. And we might as well throw on a ton of new French oak. The result is excess, imbalance.",Angels' Peak,82,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Terlato

The finish is tight, focused and fresh, with herbal shadings.",Columbine Special Reserve Single Vineyard,87,18.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,William Cole

Argentina,"A good value Cabernet from Argentina? You bet. This one smells like a bowl full of berries touched up with spice, vanilla and leather. It's fresh and ripe in the mouth, with flavors of blackberry jam and nutmeg. Smooth on the finish, it gets things right without pushing the envelope.",Select,87,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trivento
Germany,"A dry, stony, somewhat neutral wine, marked by crisp acids and vaguely apple-y fruit. The crispnesss and austerity would make it a fine foil for creamy or oily fish dishes.",Trocken,85,24.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Fritz Haag

US,"One of the most successful Bordeaux blends to come out of Sonoma Valley lately, this wine is dry and earthy, providing a nice alternative to today's super-fruity, overripe style.

Really stylish for drinking now.",Serres Ranch,91,20.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Highway 12

US,"The vineyard is 1,800 feet up the mountain and the wine was made by Randy Dunn's (Dunn Vineyards) son, Mike. Howell Mountain produces some of California's densest, most ageworthy red wines, and this big, dry, tannic Pet is a sure cellar candidate. Packed with blackberry, coffee, plum, leather and spice flavors, it should start to open up by 2009 and improve for several years after.",,92,40.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Petite Sirah,Retro

US,"This is the most accessible, most interesting and most compelling of Sbragia's new Cabernets. It's extraordinarily powerful in the potent, sweetly refined tannins and ripe flavors of blackberries and cassis, leading to a long, rich finish. You can drink it now, but it will age effortlessly for a good 8–10 years.",Rancho Del Oso,95,75.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sbragia

New Zealand,"Full bodied and richly textured, this starts off with jammy mixed-berry aromas framed by cedar, vanilla and a touch of pepper, but the palate shows even more complexity and savory characters, hinting at meat, olive and clove. Long and velvety on the finish, the 2009 Deerstalkers is a compelling example of Hawke's Bay Syrah",Deerstalkers,93,,Hawke's Bay,,,Syrah,Sacred Hill
Spain,A ripe fruity set of berry and cassis aromas shows a slight hint of raisin. This is a stacked saturated wine with raw tannins and plenty of power.

Australia,"This Chardonnay is a glowing-gold color, and its further impressions live up to the expectation that you get from its appearance: buttery/nutty aromas, and a buttery texture. Structure and concentration are also not strengths here. Very expensive for what's in the bottle. 2,000 cases produced. Imported by Aussie Imports.",The Enclosure,82,30.0,Victoria,Mornington Peninsula,,Chardonnay,Box Stallion
Spain,"Talk about a ripped, structured wine that could use more rest. This pumps out minerally blackberry and coconut aromas along with raw, inky intensity. The wine's texture is defined by a strong tannic backbone, while flavors of burnt toast, bacon, licorice and black fruits finish with graphite and energy. Drink from 2015–2023.",Edición Limitada,93,69.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de Elciego
US,"This captivating wine treads the line between Rhône and Bordeaux. A splash of Cabernet, though just a fraction of the blend, stands out. The wine has depth and persistence, and the mix of grapes works well, showing brambly red fruits, like a Zin, spice and pepper, like Syrah, and some herbal and leafy tobacco in the finish. Complex, unique and quite appealing.",Vixen Red Wine,91,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Sinclair Estate Vineyards
US,"The Legacy bottling is sourced from 20-year old vines from the estate vineyard. Elegant and tart, this complex wine brings bright flavors of raspberry into focus with hints of biscuit, vanilla and milk chocolate.

US,"Soft, ripe and dry, this wine, with a little Merlot and Cab Franc, is largely from Beckstoffer's Tokalon Vineyard, with a dollop from the winery's Spring Mountain estate. The wine is complex, young and comes together harmoniously, but needs some time to develop.

Portugal,"This wine feels big and burly, its tannins powering through the fruit. It has a strong structure, firm black plums, the acidity giving a lift to the weight of dark fruits. It needs aging, over the next 4–5 years.",Tinto,91,,Lisboa,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta de Chocapalha
US,"A bit rough, but once you factor the price in, this is a decent buy. The balanced ripe blackberry flavors will elevate a hamburger.",,85,14.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Quail Ridge
Germany,"Starts off with beautiful scents of minerals, dried spices and a hint of peach, but not quite as attractive on the palate, where it seems heavy at times despite some unreleased CO2. Then it turns tangy-tart on the finish. This youthful wine comes across as a bit disjointed; hopefully, that will improve over the next few months in bottle and this rating will look conservative.",Trocken QbA,85,16.0,Pfalz,,,Riesling,Geh. Rat Dr. von Bassermann-Jordan
Italy,"Light and garden fresh, with apple-based aromas. Not excessively expressive, but still full of chunky green apple, citrus and honeydew melon flavors. Cleansing, with a sorbet quality. Off-dry but not sugary sweet. Shows decent style and precision.",Sergio Extra Dry Spumante,88,18.0,Veneto,Prosecco di Valdobbiadene,,Prosecco,Mionetto
Chile,"Talk about a magnetic opening; this delectable wine gushes peach and apricot along with honeyed apple and mulled cider flavors.

Captures the European style of late harvest dessert wines.",Late Harvest Botrytised Grapes,90,25.0,Curicó Valley,,,Gewürztraminer,Montes

The price is fair.",Sustainable White,84,11.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Red Blend,Parducci

US,"From the estate vineyard, a windblown hilltop in the western end of the valley, this lean, yet creamy SB rewards your attention with subtle, clean, nicely crafted flavors.

Italy,"Bold and inky, this wine is made from the little-known Casavecchia grape. It opens with notes of bitter chocolate, cherry, blackberry, cured meat and savory crushed peppercorn.

US,"From the southern part of the valley, near Sebastopol, comes this young, juicy, crisp Pinot. It's marked by fruit. The freshly crushed flavors of ripe raspberries and cherries are enormously attractive, accented with toasty oak and Asian spices. But the wine has a youthful, acidic tightness that suggests aging. Best now, with decanting, and for six years.",Jennifer's,92,55.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court

US,"Though De Loach's Lake County Zinfandel—a regular in the producer's line-up of prominent wines—is a departure of form in its big-boned nature, it is entirely in keeping with its sister wines in terms of balance.

This is a fine food-pairing wine.",Nova Vineyard,92,32.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,De Loach

US,"Benton-Lane makes quite a lot of Pinot Gris, stainless-steel fermented and whole cluster pressed, yielding a soft, fragrant, fruity wine with plenty of fresh pear flavor. It flattens out broadly across the palate, full-bodied and lightly spicy. Just a bit more focus would really elevate this wine to the top ranks.",,88,17.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris,Benton-Lane
Argentina,"Smooth and consistent Malbec from Cafayate is what Michel Torino is all about. Don David is a higher-aiming effort, and while it shows a touch of northern Argentina's herbal, sun-affected characteristics, it's also a well-balanced, formulaic Malbec that hits all the markers: good color, nice body, friendly tannins and plenty of oak.",Don David Reserve,88,15.0,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec,Michel Torino
US,"A multivarietal, multivintage blend of various reds going back to 1997, this wine is very dry and, in its own way, complex. The older wines soften it and lend dried fruit notes, the younger ones keep it vibrant with a suggestion of red cherries and sweet tobacco. The end result is really fascinating.",Ol' Red,88,12.0,California,California,California Other,Red Blend,M. Cosentino

US,"Here's a wine that has some pleasant features, namely the gentle tannins and fine, oaky veneer. But the fruit is thin, and the wine stuggles to impress the palate with depth. Seems seriously overpriced. Mostly Cab Sauv, with Merlot and Cab Franc.",Red Wine,84,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Juslyn Vineyards

US,"This is one of the most successful Syrah-Cabernet Franc blends in California.

Austria,"Big, rich and oily, with intense aromas of smoke and nut oil that build on the palate into flavors of peach kernel, spice and layers of minerality.

Argentina,"Black as night, with aromas of leather, wild berries and wet dog. It is salty and oaky in the mouth, with vanilla and tannin but not a whole lot of ripe, lovable dark fruit.

Coffee notes dominate the perfumed, medium-length finish.",,88,22.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Pio Cesare
France,"Piercingly fresh Pinot Noir, with red berry flavors and vibrant acidity.

It's medium in body, with a mouthwatering, fresh finish.",,88,17.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Saint Clair

US,"Sacrashe is a great vineyard, technically in Rutherford but really in the Vaca Mountains, 750 feet high east of the Silverado Trail. Its Cabernets always are balanced and intense. Surh Luchtel has produced an oaky Cab defined by tight tannins, and although they're of the sweet modern kind, this classic, balanced, black currant-rich wine is one you want to cellar for five to eight years.",Sacrashe Vineyard,93,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Surh Luchtel
South Africa,"Truly a unique Shiraz, with its smoky, leathery and black olive aromas, followed by flavors of black cherry and spice.

Though it passes 15% alcohol, it is neither sweet nor unctuous; the fine acidity cuts through beautifully. This will certainly benefit from a few more years of cellaring.",Champoux Vineyard,91,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Sineann

Australia,"To me, Glen Eldon's Dry Bore Shiraz exemplifies many of the positive attributes of Barossa Shiraz. The blackberry fruit is powerful, complemented by copious vanilla and toast notes from oak maturation. There's plenty of weight and concentration, but no excessively dry or hard tannins—in fact, it's almost silky. Finally, there's the promise of leathery complexity to come, all at a realistic price.",Dry Bore,92,29.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Glen Eldon

Sure enough: this wine offers very little in terms of aromatics or density.",,83,,Veneto,Veneto,,Pinot Grigio,Oggi!
US,"Same vineyards as the '04, but a riper, deeper, denser vintage. This is good Washington merlot, with muscle, extract and plenty of stuffing.

Nicely built, still tight and chewy.",,89,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Tamarack Cellars

There's a woody sense to the palate as well, with espresso and cherry liqueur.",Repertoire,88,22.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blend,Harmony Cellars
France,"The nose is both supple and rich with its suggestion of ripe pear.

Chile,"Nicely done and balanced, especially for Chilean rosé comprised of heavier grape types like Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz.

US,"OS (formerly Owen-Sullivan) has hit a home run with the 2003 Ulysses, a voluptuous red that is 60% Cabernet Franc, 30% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. Extracted and volatile, it's not a bashful wine, but it has many layers of nuanced flavors that expand in the glass, filling the nose with dried herbs, mineral, leaf, coffee and scorched earth.",Sheridan Vineyard Ulysses,93,50.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,OS Winery
US,"Too soft in structure, with a collapsed feeling behind the cherry-berry flavors, and also too high in alcohol. Glycerine gives the wine a sweet taste, although it's probably technically dry.",,82,19.0,California,Calaveras County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Chatom
Argentina,"The “oak” in the name is appropriate because this one is draped in unctuous, heavy, burnt aromas. The nose is a cloud of coconut, char and woody blackberry, while the syrupy palate is all sweet black plum, carob, mint and resin. Quite oaky and thick for a value-priced wine.",Vika Oak,83,12.0,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Bodegas La Guarda
Italy,"Here's a Prosecco at a crossroads. The nose is complex and rich with exotic spice, peach, melon and dried herbs that wins it high marks.

Portugal,"Always an elegant wine, the Aragonez shows its beautiful smooth fruit, flavors of blueberries with leathery tannins and fine acidity. With its structure it could age, but there's no need to wait.",Aragonez,89,45.0,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Cortes de Cima
US,"This is a complicated young Pinot; and while the parts are all pretty and polished, they haven't knitted together. Voluptuous flavors of cherries, cola, spices and cedar are wrapped into silky tannins, and the acidity is fine and brisk, but as good as the wine is, it seems unfinished, like the score to a symphony that has yet to be played. Give this until mid-2008, and it should be terrific for the next four years.",Nicole's Vineyard,92,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery

US,"Pours dramatically dark and brooding, with an enormous burst of white pepper, blackberry and coffee and an edge of smoked meat and leather.

Australia,"Out of the chute, the aromas are sweet and cloying, but settle to reveal cured meat and leather notes.

US,"This splendid effort is sourced from the Durant Vineyard, and aged in neutral French oak for seven months prior to bottling. Spicy and dense, it's a lively blend of lime, apple, apricot and pear fruits. A trickle of juicy acidity pulls the flavors through into a finish with streaks of vanilla and clove.

US,"This is surprisingly tough and tannic for a 2007, but it does show the vintage's impressive fruit flavors.

Spain,"Gritty tarry slightly gaseous aromas of jammy black fruits are a bit less than precise. This feels flush but soft around the edges.

The intensity, the quality of the mouthfeel, the fine focus of the fruit and spice aromas and its long persistency are stratospheric.

Spain,"Quite brambly and funky, with a roasted “country” quality that points it toward leather and rubber.

Israel,"With 18 months spent in oak, the wood influence is certainly apparent, but it's balanced by the deep black plum and cherry notes.

A major league wine, brilliantly packed with currant, black cherry, licorice and pepper flavors whose power is hard to exaggerate.

Tight, complex and compact, it's drinkable right now for the primary, berry flavors; but it's not a simple wine; cellaring will allow it to evolve and bring out the more subtle textures, the elegant mix of herbs; all the things that make pure Cabernet such a pleasure when it's done well.",,92,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hestia Cellars

Very nice by itself or with a wide range of foods.",,88,16.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Valley of the Moon
Portugal,"A light, bright and fresh wine, the epitome of a fruity rosé, this is made from Moscatel Roxo, a pink-skinned grape. It has plenty of lively acidity, a lightly perfumed character and a final burst of red fruits.",Colecção Privada Roxo,86,,Península de Setúbal,,,Rosé,José Maria da Fonseca
Chile,"Woodsy berry aromas keep the nose upright and welcoming, but the palate doesn't do much other than push generic raspberry and cherry skin flavors. It's a forward, rather acidic wine that's simple and straightforward.",Reserva,83,11.0,Maipo Valley,,,Carmenère,Porta
US,"This blend of 43% Grenache, 32% Petite Sirah and 25% Syrah shows dense berry aromas along with cherry muffins and violets on the nose. The palate offers interestingly chalky boysenberries and a hint of cocoa dust, but is overwhelmed by a slight sourness and cooked fruit character.",Carnal,87,,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Oso Libre
Germany,"This straight-ahead bottling from the Loosen brothers is simply labeled Riesling.It has a surprisingly rich nose with hints of hay, diesel and citrus, while the palate shows ripe, concentrated yellow fruits. Low in alcohol (8.5%) and modest in price, this is a perfect introduction to Mosel Riesling and a great everyday wine for our Chardonnay-obsessed land. Best Buy.",,86,10.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Dr. Loosen
France,"One of the stars in the world of the crus bourgeois, categorized as cru bourgeois exceptionnel in 2003, this wine is qualitatively at the level of many classed growths. Its rich fruit is punctuated with toasty new wood flavors, which should soften and balance in the next few years. An impressive wine that shows great power.",,93,33.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut-Marbuzet

Argentina,"The nose exudes popcorn, butter and spice, while the palate is downright resiny. In between all the barrel (or is it stave?) influence, the wine shows moderately plump pear and apple flavors. But the oak is always dominant, with the mouthfeel as the wine's saving grace.",Maipu Vineyards,84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Pascual Toso

Australia,"This Chardonnay takes a little while to unfold in the glass, but when it does, fresh vanilla bean and cream aromas emerge. More of the same follows through on the palate, where there's also some almond and fresh white peach flavors. Zips shut with a burst of lemon. Suave, and will only improve with age.

New Zealand,"Neudorf seems to do almost everything well, and the winery's efforts with Riesling off the Moutere clays are no exception.

France,"91-93 Barrel sample. With its dryness, this seems at first to be all tannin. There is, though, a black currant fruit flavor that shows through after the wine has been in the mouth for a while, and the aftertaste has fine acidity. This should develop well.",Barrel sample,92,,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Latour-Martillac
Germany,"At only 6% alcohol, this is extremely honeyed on the nose—almost caramelized in its intensity.

Lingers terrifically on the finish.",Erdener Prälat Beerenauslese,94,86.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Schmitges
Spain,"Fresh cherry and plum aromas are a bit scratchy but alert. This feels firm, with bright acidity creating a raw sense on the palate.

Portugal,"There is a satisfying blend of Merlot and Syrah with Aragonez and Touriga Nacional to give a fruity wine that also manages to retain a strongly tannic structure. It's ripe, full in red fruit tones and can be drunk early, but will be better after 2015.",Serras de Azeitão Seleção do Enólogo,88,,Península de Setúbal,,,Portuguese Red,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal
France,"Shows the wood from barrel fermentation and maturation a bit on the nose, but also plenty of citrus. It's broad, yet reined in a bit by oak spice right now, needing time to flesh out. Hard to say it's better than the excellent '04 version, but it's still excellent.",Au Coeur des Siècles,91,,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,Cave de Tain

France,"There is something heady about this: a hint of chamomile tincture and pure lemon zest. The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling. Don't drink this now but wait: Drink 2020–2035.",Engelberg Grand Cru,95,45.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaine Pfister

US,"Here's a raspingly tannic, high-acid wine that feels astringently dry at first. Then the cherry flavors kick in, and all sorts of complexing herbs, spices and oak influences. It's an interesting red, but those tannins and acids call for something rich and Italian, like chicken cacciatore.",Artist Collection,89,24.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Imagery
Spain,"Leathery and smoky, with woodsy aromas as well as the essence of dried red fruits. Like many classic Rioja, it's a touch racy and acidic, but that zest pushes the cherry, cranberry and raspberry fruit toward an even finish. As a whole it's snappy, with a solid core.",Coto Real Reserva,88,42.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,El Coto

US,"With close to 2% residual sugar, this seems as if it would show some sweetness.

Germany,"While intensely youthful on the nose with aromas of fresh red cherries and blossom, the wine seems to build in depth and maturity on the palate. Fresh red fruit turns deeper and darker, and pretty floral notes pick up hints of potpourri and fall foliage. Elegant yet seductive, it is delicious now, but should mature beautifully through 2019–2021.",Trocken,91,20.0,Rheinhessen,,,Spätburgunder,Thörle
US,"Still strong and jammy at the age of four-plus, with fresh blackberry, black currant and spicy oak flavors brightened with zingy acidity.

US,"Aromatically this wine offers a lot of pleasant things, from anise and violet to pretty dark cherry and blackberry fruit. The tannins are pronounced and leathery, the mouthfeel quite concentrated, making it a hearty wine that could take a little more time in bottle to come around. The 2009 is more accessible.",Shake Ridge Vineyards,87,38.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Tempranillo,Yorba

US,"It's necessary to talk about alcohol levels with Saxum's wines, because they define the style. With this one, it's 16.4%, higher than almost any commercially-released red table wine in California. That's almost Port. It's vast in chocolate, raspberry purée, cherry jam, anisette and cassis flavors. That makes it sound sweet, but it's dry and smoothly tannic. Saxum fans will exult.

US,"Not the best Monte Bello to emerge in recent years. There's a sharpness of acidity that cuts the palate, and it accentuates the fresh fruit, giving it a jammy zing.

Italy,"Easy, simple and clean, this Extra Dry Prosecco from the Treviso area of northeast Italy opens with dry notes of grass and herb, followed by sweeter layers of peach and grapefruit.",Extra Dry,85,,Veneto,Prosecco,,Glera,Cantina Produttori di Valdobbiadene
US,"This is quite a rich wine, and although it can't quite overcome Petite Sirah's rustic character, it is a great example of the variety. Fully dry and full-bodied, with thick tannins, it's filled with blackberry, black cherry and mocha flavors, with a meaty edge.",Ripken Vineyard,87,18.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Petite Sirah,Sheldon
France,"Winemaker Pierre Jehan's interpretation of Corton-Charlemagne for Henri de Villamont is to retain great fruit, but not to produce a wine with too much weight. The advantage is rich wine, with spicy pear and ripe yellow fruits, but with a great bounce of acidity.",,92,102.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Henri de Villamont
France,"A fine combination of apples and cream flavors and a powerful mineral texture, showing a generous side of Sauvignon Blanc, with apricots and peaches as well as an intense layer of citrus. The final flavors are of spice, vanilla mixed with crisp acidity.",Les Romains,92,59.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Vacheron
US,"A bit shy on the nose, this appellation-blend bottling shows light cola, red cherry and wet slate aromas. The palate is tightly wound and very earthy, with turned loam, strong wet clay, oregano, sage, pomegranate and hibiscus elements all playing together nicely.",,89,35.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Grenache,Casa Dumetz
Italy,"Among the greatest expressions of Fiano, Cometa is a full and generous effort, with deep layers of passion fruit and stone fruit, plus touches of vanilla, honey and light spice. The concentration and freshness is wonderful, and the wine would pair well with steamed lobsters or buttery crab legs.",Cometa,92,43.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Fiano,Planeta
Spain,"Aromas of lees and buttercup come with a hint of tropical fruit. This fading, Albariño is plump and generic in feel, without much cut or minerality. Melon, apple and pithy citrus flavors finish similarly, with mild bitterness.",,85,22.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Rectoral do Umia
US,"Unusual for a 2003 Cab to be held back this long before release. Maybe they thought the tannins were too strong. They're fully resolved now, but the fruit has faded, leaving behind mild flavors of dried cherries, currants and herbs that finish very dry. It's an elegant wine, rather than a voluptuous one.",L Vineyard,86,42.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,D'Argenzio
US,"Rich, with restrained intensity, this has aromas of toasted graham-cracker crumb, spiced orange marmalade, peach preserves and wilted rose. It feels slightly pudgy on the midpalate, with a tapering finish that ends on a buttered-caramel note.",Late Harvest,87,30.0,Virginia,Virginia,,Petit Manseng,Tarara
US,"This is one of the sweetest white California dessert wines out there. It's addictively decadent, like an upscale Sauternes. Barrel fermentation in new French oak gives an opulent, palate-flattering honeyed vanilla richness to the apricot, peach, pineapple and crème brûlée flavors that are so rich and refined. Crisp acidity provide clean, vibrant balance. Just gorgeous, and worth the price.",Botrytised,95,55.0,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sémillon,Chalk Hill
US,"Crisp and racy, it reveals layers of honeysuckle, Meyer lemons, gingersnap cookies and crushed brown spices, especially cinnamon. The blend is Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Gewürztraminer. And what a great price. Production was 1,738 cases.",Trinity Bianco,89,16.0,California,California,California Other,White Blend,Soquel Vineyards
France,"While this wine has an attractive honey character, it is only lightly sweet. It's more about acidity balanced with richness and a wonderful orange-zest character that gives a lift as well as bright aftertaste. The wine needs until 2016 to get its full act together.",Pas de Deux,88,,Southwest France,Jurançon,,Gros and Petit Manseng,Domaine Nigri
US,"A single vineyard, 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, this is deep, dark, dense, chewy and tannic. Yet it still captures some delicate floral aromas as well as smoke and rock and black fruits.

Italy,"A taut red made of 70% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this has ripe black plum, leather and dried herb aromas. The firmly structured palate delivers dried black cherry, tobacco and clove flavors, accompanied by a touch of aniseed. Tightly knit tannins pull it all together. Drink through 2020.",Grumarello Riserva,90,23.0,Tuscany,Carmignano,,Red Blend,Artimino
US,"A bit sharp in the mouth, with a cut of tartness that age is unlikely to soften. Otherwise, this blend of mostly Merlot, with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, is polished and dry, with blackberry and black currant flavors.",Maylena,86,49.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Inspiri
Italy,"Black, dense and thickly concentrated, this modern Barbera d'Asti Superiore shows loads of wood influence in front of the fruit.

US,"Scores high on the deliciousness scale, with melted chocolate, blackberry jam, red cherry pie and vanilla-coffee flavors. What's not to like? This Merlot-based wine is soft and creamy and dry.

South Africa,"There's a nice underlying minerality to this wine, complemented by aromas and flavors of crisp red apple, melon and lime oil.

South Africa,"A firm, spicy backbone gives this Shiraz heft, but it's balanced by juicy red fruit and soft floral notes that keep it from becoming too austere. Complex but not complicated, it's a great example of the restrained but flavorful elegance for which South African Shiraz is known. A touch of smoke adds character.",,87,20.0,Stellenbosch,,,Shiraz,Radford Dale
US,"Acidity marks this fresh, young Pinot Noir. It's as if the raspberry and cherry wine has been enlivened with a splash or three of lime juice. This primary fruit tartness may be because the wine was bottled and rushed to market too early. Don't drink it now. Give it a year or two to integrate.",Morning Dew Vineyard,87,47.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Drew
Italy,"This opens with an attractive fragrance of ripe plum, violet, aromatic herb and baking spice.

US,"It's been such a pleasure to watch Martin Ray expand into their appellation series of Cabernet Sauvignons, which they do with such aplomb.

Italy,"This is a beautiful expression of Chardonnay from Sicily that hits all the right spots. The wine is fresh and fragrant and there are sophisticated notes here of honeysuckle, passion fruit and a touch of toasted almond.

Argentina,"Big, dark, sweet and jammy on the nose, with earthy, candied, sweet aromas of ripe blackberry and herbs. The palate delivers bouncy, showy acidity, while the flavors of black cherry, dark plum and chocolate are solid and rewarding.

It washes clean over the tongue thanks to its natural consistency and fresh acidity.",Brognoligo,87,,Veneto,Soave Classico,,Garganega,Cecilia Beretta

US,"Good, rich Cab from this veteran producer, but falls shy of greatness. The power comes from the authority of the tannins and currant-cassis fruit, and there's elegance in the overall balance. Falls short, though, for an overripe raisiny edge in the finish.",,87,48.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stags' Leap Winery
US,"This firm, tannic merlot is a step up in concentration from the winery's regular bottling. It's ripe, focused and still a bit tight, with stacked layers of berry, plum and cassis.

Argentina,"Argentinean Rieslings come along as often as Haley's comet. But this clean, round wine is pretty good in its own right.

Not entirely a novelty with 1,550 cases total production.",,85,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Riesling,Luigi Bosca
Chile,"We believe this is what bargain hunters want from their value-priced Merlot. The wine has soft, stylish berry and toasted oak aromas and then a juicy but balanced palate with proper acidity, slight tannins and solid red-berry flavors. A good package for all occasions.",Reserva,87,9.0,Maule Valley,,,Merlot,Calina
US,"This is an exciting wine, simultaneously serious and fun, with a steely minerality and clean nectarine on the nose. The palate is energetic, showing both tight limestone and more deliciously hedonistic notes of Fuji apples and Japanese pear. The acidity kicks expertly throughout.",Thompson Vineyard,92,27.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Grenache Blanc,Jaffurs
Australia,"Starts off with herbal, almost rhubarb-like aromas, but also some darker, berry-scented notes that ease into flavors of cassis and herbs. The texture is almost creamy, with the structure of the wine formed more by crisp acids than sturdy tannins.",The High Trellis,85,19.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Cabernet Sauvignon,D'Arenberg
Argentina,"Hands down, this is the finest Pinot Noir from South America that I've ever tasted, and that includes Chile, Argentina and anyplace else. Italy's Piero Incisa della Rocchetta of Sassicaia fame started this project in 2004, and it's now finding a groove. This wine is as elegant as Burgundy but as full of flavor as something from California. The color is rosy, the aromas beguiling, and the meeting of oak and fruit just perfect. Terrific for contemplating on its own or with food. Versatility should be its middle name.",No. 55,94,100.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Pinot Noir,Bodega Chacra

US,"Tart and leafy, this pure Malbec shows good grip and concentration. Sour raspberry fruit flavors and sharp acids are complemented with barrel spice from aging in once-used French oak.

US,"Insanely rich, this explodes in the mouth with orange, pineapple, apricot, tropical fruit and sweet new-oak flavors.

France,"Very structured and firm, this has the weight, richness and power that is typical of Echézeaux. It's the tension between the tannins and the ripe black fruits that give this wine its great aging ability and depth of flavor. It needs at least six years.",,95,225.0,Burgundy,Echézeaux,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Faiveley
Italy,"This has aromas of yellow flower and orchard fruit while the rather lean palate shows green pear, saline and obvious alcohol. A note of bitter almond closes it down.",,86,17.0,Southern Italy,Falanghina del Sannio,,Falanghina,Cantine Foschini

US,"This gentle, lightly off-dry Riesling was fermented primarily in neutral oak, which seems to have softened the entry without impacting the flavors. Aromatic highlights of honeysuckle and orange marmalade introduce a full palate with a complex fruit mix including raspberry, citrus and orange. The finish brings an impression of cotton candy.",Nicholas Estate,90,19.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Anam Cara
Italy,"A crystalline appearance is a preface for polished aromas of citrus, pineapple and tangerine. This is a fresh and fruity sparkler that stands out thanks to the zesty and cleansing impression it leaves in the mouth.

France,"One of the top Vouvray sparkling wines, this 2012 is still young. That gives it almond, quince and pear flavors along with intense bright acidity.

US,"As in past vintages, this is half DuBrul and half Meek vineyard fruit. It's a far cry from what most consumers would think of as Merlot—this is a stiff, tannic, muscular wine, with a deep earthiness that speaks of rich loam and ancient rock. It strikes me as more typical of Malbec.

US,"You'll want to cellar this young Cab because presently it's too tannic and closed in for pleasure. Yet it has the stuffing to age.

Chile,"This rating is probably as much a reflection of tasting the wine too late in its evolution as anything else. At this mature state, the wine is heavy and syrupy, with stalky, almost bitter red-fruit flavors. Finishes with matchstick and grassy flavors. Wait for the 2011.",Cherub Rosé of Syrah,82,20.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Rosé,Montes
US,"This wine starts out strongly reduced, making it a challenge to get at the pink grapefruit, lychee and spice aromas. The flavors drink just off dry, with high wire acidity. There are good things going on but the reduction is a challenge to overcome.",Dragonfly,87,25.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Gewürztraminer,Francis Tannahill

US,"A big, vital wine, mouth-filling and dense, with plenty of weight and volume, and deep flavors of earth, chocolate, blackberry and sweet currant. The cool '09 vintage has resulted in this version of Cask 23 being lighter in alcohol and tighter than others like the 2008.

The flavors are of cherries, raspberries, currants and cola, with nuances of licorice and gingerbread, yet for all that the finish is totally dry. So powerful is the wine in itself that it easily shoulders the 100% new French oak, which pushes the richness into a smoky, ne plus ultra territory.

Not overly complex but certainly enticing, the wine is both rich and sensible, and will pair well with BBQ, lamb and spiced meat dishes.",,87,10.0,Robertson,,,Shiraz,Excelsior
France,"90-92 Barrel sample. Spice and dry botrytis are what this wine is about. There's a wood element as well, which dominates the fruit and the flavors of baked apples and cinnamon. Like all the drier styles, this will be a good food wine.",Barrel sample,91,,Bordeaux,Barsac,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Coutet
Italy,"Well etched, defined and crisp, this is a strong, determined wine with loads of power, acidity and firmness. The wine shows all the criteria for a long cellar life, softening slowly as the wine evolves. Age 10–20 more years.",Riserva,93,49.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Canneta
US,"Soft, decadent and approachable, this Cabernet Sauvignon is blended with a little Malbec. It offers flavors of blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and cedar that continue on the long, spicy finish. This is lovely to drink now and over the next five years.",Stagecoach Vineyard,95,90.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Patland
New Zealand,"Tohu is a wine company owned by New Zealand's indigenous peoples, the Maori. The wines have been mixed over the years, but this is an excellent bottling. It boasts a full, ample mouthfeel and plenty of supple tannins. Black cherry fruit marries well with complex savory notes, while hints of pomegranate brighten the aromas. Drink now.",Single Vineyard,90,23.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Tohu
Argentina,"Once you cut through the heavy, minty oak, there's a decent wine hiding in the folds. The body carries reasonably ripe black cherry and raspberry flavors as well as plenty of wood-generated tannin, but does it taste much like Syrah? I find it more generic and woody than varietal.  Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Select,83,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Trivento
US,"A big, dark wine, with deep flavors of red and black stone fruits, and wild blackberries. Despite the size, it's a simple wine, easy to understand—it's a ribs-and-barbecued-chicken wine. A Bordeaux-style blend, but with 36% Howell Mountain Zinfandel.",Bodog Red,86,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Spelletich Cellars
Chile,"Chunky and bland on the nose, this is honeyed and sticky in the mouth. Flavors of unctuous tropical fruits finish like candy corn. There's not much spine to this overly ripe Chardonnay.",Antiguas Reservas,83,16.0,Maipo Valley,,,Chardonnay,Cousiño-Macul
New Zealand,"The philosophy here is to rely on bottle age to bring the acids into balance, rather than doing a lot of malolactic fermentation. The current release is this '97 when most producers are onto the '99s. Despite only 15% malo, there's a creamy richness to this wine in the mouth to go with delicate toast and bold pineapple flavors that pick up anise and black pepper notes on the finish.",Reserve,89,22.0,Marlborough,,,Chardonnay,Wairau River
France,"The wine has some of the typical freshness of 2011 but it seems on the thin side. Black currant flavors run alongside high acidity, and the tannins show strongly. The aftertaste brings out more tight, mineral acidity.",,84,35.0,Bordeaux,Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château la Petite Roque
US,"Don't drink this beauty too cold with your lobster, crab or scallops. It has the weight of a noble wine, with minerality and creaminess giving shape and texture to the leesy, yeasty flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie and ripe pear purée. Aged in 40% new French oak, California Chardonnay hardly gets any better than this.",Ashley's Vineyard,95,28.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Fess Parker

US,"The fruit component of this wine is at first elusive, its aromas dominated by dust, earth and saddle leather, but it opens over time into plum and chocolate and a sweetly spicy layer too. It's structured like a wall, so give this baby some time to further develop its assets.",Granite Hill Reserve,87,30.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Petite Sirah,Lava Cap
Germany,"Rose petals and honey perfume this gorgeously aromatic dry Riesling, accenting ripe, succulent flavors of caramelized sugar and peaches on the palate. It's big bodied and slightly viscous in mouthfeel, but a shock of grapefruit acidity lends elegance and balance.",Wachenheimer Dry,90,16.0,Pfalz,,,Riesling,Villa Wolf
Spain,"A barrel-fermented Verdejo, which will work for some and seem wrong to others. The nose is wood-heavy, with smoke, butterscotch and licorice. In the mouth, it's ripe and full of spiced pear and vanilla flavors. A one-trick pony in that it's dominated by oak. Still, the quality of the fruit and oak is solid.",Naia Des,88,28.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Viña Sila
Spain,"Smells like compost, and never does that earthy, stenchiness lift. The palate is thick and muddled, with wan, dry, buttery raspberry flavors that lack direction. Finishes dry and bland, without much structure.",Roble,82,20.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Convento Oreja

France,"Rich and becoming smooth, this wine is the product of fine ripe Merlot. It is packed with fruit, with tannins that are now integrated and a generous amount of weight and concentration. This is already an attractive wine, although it will be better from 2019.",,91,28.0,Bordeaux,Lalande de Pomerol,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Clos l'Hermitage

Spain,"Tight on the nose but also a bit oxidized and yeasty smelling. Feels more tangy and juicy than Alvear's Fino en Rama, with forward acidity, bite and cut.

Chile,"Generally ripe, clean and fresh. Smells pure and spicy, with blackberry aromas setting up a crisp palate. Tastes a little herbal as do almost all Chilean Merlots, but the berry fruit and spice elements are uncompromised and uncomplicated. A likable value Merlot.",Estate Reserva,87,12.0,Curicó Valley,,,Merlot,Errazuriz
US,"Not quite enough Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine to varietally label it, and kudos to the winemaker for blending in Merlot and Cab Franc, which increases complexity. Fully ready to drink now, the wine is dry and succulent in cherries, blackberries, cocoa and new oaky flavors, with a rich tug of tannins.",The Highlands,89,18.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Magito
US,"Black and white pepper pop from the glass in this cool-climate, cool-vintage wine that retains just enough power around lacy acidity. A bouquet of violets rises on the nose before the palate offers spicy, lean bursts of meat, leather and black licorice. Made in small amounts, this wine is well worth seeking.",Vivio Vineyard,94,50.0,California,Bennett Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Red Car
US,"A good, dry wine that's stuffed with richly ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants. Yet it has a tough astringency, a cut of tannins and acids that makes it brittle and limits immediate reward. Could develop in the bottle, but not much beyond 2012.",Huerhuero,87,22.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vina Robles
France,"A very soft style of wine, perhaps lacking distinctive character, but offering attractive ripe red fruits. There is some minerality, and the acidity is obvious, especially in the aftertaste. It is missing flesh and weight and should be drunk now.",,87,40.0,Burgundy,Monthélie,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
France,"This powerfully built Gigondas appears to have 5–8 years of aging potential, so perhaps in time this rating will look conservative. For the moment, the wine displays balanced aromas and flavors of garrigue, leather and plum along with a firm tannic structure. The blend is 80% Grenache, 10% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre.",Saveur des Dentelles,88,40.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine des Florets

US,"Lush in pineapple cream, Key lime pie, kiwi fruit, white peach and apricot flavors, this Chardonnay is as rich as they come. There's also a welcome overlay of zesty, citrusy acidity. The finish is honey sweet, in the modern style.",Peters Vineyard,89,28.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kokomo
US,"Very high-toned for a relatively affordable wine, this shows Key lime pith, Greek yogurt, scratched pink grapefruit skin and a fresh 7-Up soda liveliness on the nose. Anjou peas, seared green apples, lime zest and nectarine power the pleasant energy on the palate, which wipes up clean with a vanilla finish.",Flor de Campo,91,22.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Sanford
New Zealand,"Starts off well, with aromas of toast, vanilla and black cherries. The attack is rich and sweet as well, but then the wine turns a bit drying and herbal on the finish. Needs time—but will the fruit hold?",Gimblett,86,35.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Merlot,Trinity Hill

Grippy red plum skin flavors dominate the compellingly tense palate, followed by Rainier cherry and orange rind touches.",Resistance Willow Creek Farm,89,42.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rosé,Proulx
US,"Nuanced, expressive and floral, this demonstrates balance between the tannins and mushroom-kissed Bing-cherry flavor. The palate feels soft, silky and round, and the layer of dark chocolate is the perfect finishing touch. Age it for 5–7 years, but it is also enjoyable now.",Ferrington Vineyard,93,58.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Arista
Italy,"This marches to the beat of its own drum, presenting a different style and bouquet than the average Amarone. In fact, this is thinner and more streamlined, with plump blackberry and boysenberry tones that are backed by moist earth and tobacco accents. It shows a feminine side to one of Italy's most powerful reds.",L'Amarone,88,75.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",La Collina dei Ciliegi

Spain,"Make room in the cellar for this heavyweight! Talk about a monster wine; but there's also finesse, character and style to it. Alabaster is the top wine from the Eguren family's new Toro winery, and it's big, tannic and loaded with spice, molasses and syrupy black fruit flavors.

US,"Sourced from an experimental vineyard planted in the early 1970s, this blends eight different varieties, all picked on the same day and co-fermented. At least one red grape (Cabernet Sauvignon), adds a touch of amber to the wine. It could be called rosé, though it's listed as a white wine.

Try it with charcuterie.",Field Blend Wings of Desire,89,28.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,,White Blend,love & squalor

Italy,"One of the best Barolos of the year, Coste di Rose is a natural beauty with gorgeous, thick extraction and perfectly balanced aromas of blueberries, violets, almond paste, sweet spice and root beer.

Cellar this delightful wine ten years or more.",Coste di Rose,95,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Marchesi di Barolo
Spain,"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime. The palate is mostly fresh, though not as lively as it probably was nine months ago, while the flavors of 7Up and peach are refreshing. Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Dona Rosa,88,25.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
US,"Sommeliers, run, don't walk, to scoop this one up by the case. It's really good, a dry, softly balanced Cab that will back up food, not dominate it. Ready to drink now for its easy tannins and upfront blackberry and currant flavors.",Vineyard Selection,87,18.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Eberle
US,"Pressed directly to barrel prior to fermentation, it's dusty and fragrant, capturing the higher acidity of the vintage, and some underlying minerality.

US,"The fragrant and flavorful nose's butter, lychee and banana aromas create an alluring opening. Pink grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors accent a sweetly spicy, baked-apple mouth that has medium weight and a nice texture. The wine finishes dry and nutty, with moderate length. Smoky and lush, it's ready to drink tonight.",,90,35.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rudd

Austria,"The top wine from Weninger, this is a hugely rich, wood-aged wine that has smooth toast, licorice and herb flavors, which sustain the complex structure of tannins and the juicy, black-currant-like acidity.

US,"From a single vineyard on Snipes Mountain, this is a forceful, dark and liquorous version of Harrison Hill, which often carries more herbal accents.

US,"Cecil De Loach was famous for his Zinfandels when he owned De Loach Winery, and he shows his deft hand with this wine.

US,"Adam Tolmach picked the grapes a little earlier than usual for this low-production bottling. It's definitely not as ripe as his other Pinots, showing an aroma of grass, dried hay, nettles and sage.

South Africa,"A vibrant, fresh, violet petal and orange oil streak cuts through the overall heavy character of this wine.

Powerful but graceful, the palate delivers a vibrant core of black cherry accented with white pepper, mineral and balsamic notes alongside youthful but polished tannins and vibrant acidity.

A very nice job.",,90,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Robert Mondavi

Spain,"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon.

It's decadent and enormous in blackberries, cherries, currants, licorice, bacon and spice flavors, which are all melted into the perfect fusion of alcohol and warmth, and elaborated with smoky, toasty oak.

Argentina,"A little heat early on, and also aromas of pepper, fresh fallen leaves and dry berry fruit. It's more traditional in style, meaning it isn't pitch black, sweet and thick. Instead the wine shows earthy, mature flavors of fig paste, raspberry and cough drop. More competent than flashy.",Reserva,87,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Domaine Jean Bousquet

Australia,"A bit reticent on the nose, showing hints of struck flint, lime and custard, but this tightly coiled Chard shows its true brilliance in the mouth, revealing complex fruit flavors of lime and lemon, but also slightly riper notes: apple and white peach come to mind.

US,"Wow. An incredible (and affordable) example of what Mourvèdre can be in certain nooks and crannies of the Sierra Foothills and in certain hands. Here winemaker and owner Hank Beckmeyer has made a silk mountai wine out of a tough vintage, taking organically farmed Mourvèdre from the folks over at Cedarville (who have their own label too) and made a gorgeous, pure and rich Rhône with perfumed notes of plum, smooth spice and a good dose of earth, all easy on the palate with fresh acidity and a velvety texture.

US,"Assembled from the same lots as the winery's more expensive varietal wines, this high-powered, Bordeaux-style blend is one of Walla Walla's best values.

Italy,"This oak-aged Sardinian wine opens with awkward aromas of black fruit, pecorino cheese and wild mushroom that blow off after a few seconds.

US,"Another beautifully rich, satisfying Tears of Dew from EOS. This is one of California's most consistently successful dessert wines. The '08 is very sweet and opulent in honey, apricot jam, orange sorbet and crème brûlée flavors. So easy to drink, and the alcohol is refreshingly low at 11%.",Tears of Dew Late Harvest,92,22.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Moscato,EOS
Australia,"Aromatic, with smoke, earth and barbecue on the nose. Dry tannins in the mouth; black plum and oak are the principal flavors here.

Austria,"Since 1992, Hans and Kurt Feiler have produced what they call the 1000 Series, a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. This 2005 vintage follows the same theme, keeping close to a Bordeaux model, while adding extra sweetness and ripeness to the fruit. Wood aging helps soften the wine, but it is also a question of soft tannins and richness.",1011,90,52.0,Burgenland,,,Cabernet Blend,Feiler-Artinger
Italy,"Simple and straightforward. Has banana, peach and citrus flavors over a crisp but sweet finish (this has the highest sugar content of the estate's three wines).

Italy,"Aromas of mature black fruit, tobacco, allspice and mocha unfold in the glass along with a note of tilled earth.

Drink through 2019.",Bramasole,91,53.0,Tuscany,Cortona,,Syrah,La Braccesca

This is a beautiful accompaniment to grilled shellfish.",,90,22.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Bugay

New Zealand,"Produced from ""cordon-cut"" bunches, Riesling offers up intense honey, apple and pear aromas and flavors. With more than 11% residual sugar, you might expect this wine to be sticky-sweet, but thanks to crisp acids, it's not cloying. Tasty, well-balanced wine that just finishes a bit short.",Desert Gold Late Harvest,86,,Central Otago,,,Riesling,Olssens
Germany,"Smoke and crushed slate reverberate from start to finish on this intensely minerally, dry Riesling. It's linear in style with a lean, steely feel, but is anchored by delectably bright Meyer lemon and orange-peel notes on the palate.",Josephshöfer GG Trocken,91,67.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt

Age for two years at least.",La Crêle,90,,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Thomas & Fils
US,"This initially tastes like young fruit, herbal, with a lot of stem and flower flavors, but with some heat at 16% alcohol. Nonetheless it's delicious, compact, enormously fruity, focused and flat out amazing.

US,"Ballentine consistently makes one of the best Chenins in California, and while this 2009 seems rushed to market, it's a good alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.

France,"A bit light, in the style of the vintage, but with wonderfully intricate spice complexity wrapped around leather and red fruit.

Australia,"Smells like citrus and peach, with a cottony-vanilla overlay. Citrus stays the course on the palate, but the flavors are halfhearted, and the feel soft.

US,"The very fine Allen Vineyard, on Westside Road in the tenderloin of the appellation, has produced a high-quality Chardonnay that is capable of some bottle aging.

Should develop before fading, over the next 5 years.",Allen Vineyard,92,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem

Portugal,"A fine, firm, structured wine that shows richness along with elegance. Fresh, black fruits ride over dry tannins and acidity, allowing this to be a food-friendly wine that could benefit from some aging. To finish, the lifted, vibrant fruits leave a ripe, clean taste.",Grande Escolha,89,15.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Messias
Argentina,"More chunky than some in its class, with early berry flavors but not much backing that up. The wine has a little brett and rubber, and in the end it turns lean and tight. Fresh but too sharp and thin to raise the bar.",,83,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Andean Sky
Chile,"La Playa is now sourcing its reserve-level Chardonnay from Limarí in the north of Chile, and the wine shows terroir characteristics of citrus flavors and aromas topped by dancing acidity.

France,"La Grenouille, the frog, is a soft, creamy wine, but with a great waft of acidity, like biting into a green apple.

Germany,"Zesty lemon and lime aromas add elegance to unctuous white peach and apricot flavors on this delicate, yet remarkably complex wine.

Nervy citrus acidity drives a long, focused finish.",Nik Weis Wiltinger Alte Reben Ortswein Kabinett Feinherb,91,19.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,St. Urbans-Hof
Australia,"Because of its often formidable structure, d'Arenberg's The Dead Arm is a difficult wine to evaluate when young. The 2006 is dark and extracted, with intense cassis, coffee and chocolate notes but not much complexity or elegance. Those should come with time; the firmness of the lingering finish suggests cellaring through 2014.",The Dead Arm,90,65.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,D'Arenberg
Italy,"With 20% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon added to the blend, Ser Gioveto shows impressive density and staying power as well as ripe, chewy fruit aromas.

US,"Powerful vanilla scents rise from the glass, but the fruit, even in this difficult vintage, comes out immediately. It's tart and sharp, with a strong herbal component, and the wine snaps into focus quickly with fruit, acid, tannin, herb and vanilla in equal proportion. Firm and tight, still quite young, this wine needs decanting and/or further bottle age to show its best.",Seven Springs Vineyard,91,45.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Evening Land

Australia,"How can one not applaud a winery that holds back some of its top Riesling for a museum release at such a reasonable price? Developed honey and cinnamon notes accent citrus fruit, adding weight and richness to the midpalate while still finishing crisp and completely dry. It's drinking well now, but should easily hold another 10 years under its screw cap.",The Contours Museum Reserve,92,25.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Riesling,Pewsey Vale

US,"This is a very dense, bone dry and full-bodied Zin with plenty of distinctive features. It shows the wild mountain berry and enormous range of dusty Asian spice flavors you expect, but also interesting notes of dried thyme and sage that finish with sweet anise and bacon. In a word, complicated. The alcohol is high, but manageable.",Esola Vineyard,92,44.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Bella Piazza
US,"Tart and forward, with cranberry and raspberry fruit front and center, this is a tasty, acidic and lightly spicy effort that shows some nice precision. It's not a big wine, but balanced and based upon sharp acids that carry the fruit and cut through the finish.",,87,20.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Duck Pond
Italy,"A serious contender with sophisticated notes of leather, barnyard and cedar wrapped up in toasty vanilla oak. A hint of char adds an edge to a streamlined palate infused with earth, mushroom and strawberry tones. A slight lack of persistence takes it out of the top flight. Fully mature, drink now.",Amistà,89,33.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,,Barbera,Massimiliano Vivalda
Italy,"Blueberry, forest berry and a delicate floral touch round off richly toasted notes that glide smoothly over a harmonious whole.

Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",,89,46.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Col d'Orcia

France,"With its heavy bottle and designer label and name, this must qualify as the most expensive looking vin de pays from the Loire.

But the price is fine, so enjoy a lively, lightly toasty but still fresh green-fruited wine.",Attitude,87,14.0,Loire Valley,Vin de Pays du Jardin de la France,,Sauvignon Blanc,Pascal Jolivet
US,"Quite as tannic as Beringer's other limited-release single-vineyard Cabs, although a streak of buttery softness makes it drinkable now.

Austria,"A taut, terroir-driven wine that builds ripe fruits over the tight core of minerality. There is a youthful tang of orange zest over the sweet currants, while the acidity adds fresheness.

US,"Not a shy wine, but quite lively on the palate, loaded with high-toned fruits and bright acids. This is an interesting flavor mix, not jammy despite the high alcohol.

Australia,"Bright and vibrant, this blend of 56% Cabernet Sauvignon and 44% Merlot is really direct and fruity, overflowing with black cherries and vanilla.

Nicely done.",San Remo Seven Hills Vineyard,88,25.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sangiovese,Des Voigne
US,"A really wonderful Cabernet, clearly grown well and well made. It has that plush, rich feeling you want in a Cabernet Sauvignon, with deliciously ripe blackberry, black currant, cassis and dark chocolate flavors.

US,"Miner has struggled with this wine, which comes from the Central Valley, over the years, but with this '09, they've achieved a breakthrough. That may be due to the cool weather of the vintage.

US,"On its own, this Mourvèdre-based Rhône-style blend is fairly straightforward. It has candied aromas and tastes, suggesting raspberry-flavored licorice and cola.

Spain,"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on.

Italy,"A fifty-fifty blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, this densely concentrated wine has aromas that suggest underbrush, wet leaves, black berries and prune.

US,"Purple and blue, it tastes of tart cherry and blueberry fruit. The tannins are stiffer than the winery's other reds, thicker and somewhat chalkier, and they seem a bit distanced from the soft, fruity mid-palate.

US,"This wine is an absolute joy to drink, and such a great expression of its Sonoma Coast vineyard. Its dryness, acidity and minerality highlight its terroir. Its texture is light and silky. Yet it's immensely complex in flavors, suggesting red cherry, licorice and exotic spices that are so rich, they're almost sweet in the finish.

US,"From a section of the vineyard planted to only one clone, Paige's is luscious and velvety, smoothly decadent in sanguine, tangy fruit.

US,"Is it just a simple, delicious drink-me-now Pinot? Or is it actually complex and worthy of pairing with the best foods? It's both. Front-loaded with raspberry purée, smoked butter and oak flavors, it has subtle layers of mushroom and dried pine that lift it into an ethereal place. Who cares if it will age? It's drop-dead gorgeous now. Char-broiled salmon could be your best pairing.",La Brisa,93,40.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Walt
US,"Though not indicated, this is all Pepper Bridge fruit. It's got a nice mix of berries, pepper and toasty chocolate.

It's vast in chocolate, raspberry purée, cherry jam, anisette and cassis flavors. That makes it sound sweet, but it's dry and smoothly tannic. Saxum fans will exult. Others may find the wine problematic.",James Berry Vineyard Rocket Block,90,55.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Saxum

Italy,"Made by the energetic and totally enthused Lorenzo Zonin, this beautiful wine shows all the potential and charisma of this young, passionate winemaker.

It feels warm, thick and firm on the long finish.",,92,30.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Petit Verdot,Podere San Cristoforo
US,"This curious blend of 61% Riesling and 39% Sauvignon Blanc manages to succeed, with lime rinds, limestone and wafts of gasoline intriguing the nose. There's not much acidity on the palate, but it does offer a chalky grip along with limeade flavors.",Artisan,87,18.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,White Blend,Skyline Wines
US,"Dark in color, soft in structure and rather heavy, this is a good Pinot Noir that doesn't quite rise beyond a drink-me-now polish. It has jammy flavors of cherries, blackberries and mocha. Drink now.",,87,50.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Regale Winery and Vineyards

Spain,"While I prefer the 2009 for its clarity and freshness, this '08 is no slouching tiger. The nose delivers still-fresh apple and mineral aromas, while the flavor profile leans toward gooseberry, lemon and green melon. Shows some pithy bitterness on the finish, so drink right away or seek out the '09.",,88,19.0,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,,Godello,Gaba do Xil

Chile,"Tropical on the nose, with aromas of pineapple, mango and lychee. The palate is plump and highly regular, and the flavors of green banana and pithy orange and citrus are not much to ponder.

Chile,"The 2010 vintage in Chile was quite cool, and that's reflected in this wine. Aromas of berry fruits are lean and underdeveloped.

Drying tannins make for a drawing finish.",Amplus,86,22.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Ema

US,"This is the first time that Sineann has offered a reserve bottling of this wine, which does step it up even further than the “regular” Baby Poux.

Chile,"The overriding sentiment is that Limarí is too cool for Carmenère, yet this wine, while a bit sour and rhubarby, is still pretty comfy and satisfying.

US,"True to the dense, muscular style of Woodward Canyon's Merlots, this elevates the complexity in a near-perfect vintage. Deep and textural, it packs together concentrated red fruits, preserves and cassis.

Spain,"This is a new wine made by Alejandro Fernandez of Pesquera in Ribera del Duero. It's clear, defined and ripe, with earthy, spicy undercurrents supporting potent blackberry fruit.

US,"Relentless, a blend this year of mainly Syrah and Petite Sirah, is always a very good wine. The '07 strikes one as, above all, tannic and dry. Then the blackberry, black cherry, dark baker's chocolate, herb tea and smoked meat flavors kick in, impressing with their complexity. It's a distinctive wine, quite unlike anything else in California. Despite the hard tannins it's drinkable now, and will challenge chefs and sommeliers to figure out what to serve it with. The winemaker suggests braised short ribs, smoked lamb, roast duck and Cheddar cheese.",Relentless,93,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Shafer

US,"An interesting, even eccentric Syrah that's really quite different from anything else out there. No mere fruit bomb, it's a meaty wine, in the sense of being chewy, but also in the aromas and flavors of both roasted and raw beef.

Italy,"Slightly candied cherry aromas accented by carob, cocoa and herb give way to a smooth, fairly full palate with chocolate and Bing cherry flavors. This elegant wine finishes dark and dry, with full ripe tannins. Hold for two to four years; it should only improve.",,89,23.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Castello di Meleto

A hint of dried sage and almond on the close gives it extra appeal.",Brut,89,25.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Contadi Castaldi
Mexico,"Relying on fruit from the Guadalupe and Santo Tomás valleys, this wine shows a core red-berry aroma that settles on cassis and cherry notes. It's bright, acidic and fruity, with wild berry, plum and brown sugar flavors. This is long and powerful on the finish due to its juicy acidity.",Macouzet,88,30.0,Valle de Guadalupe and Santo Tomás,,,Syrah,Vinisterra

France,"A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this wine offers both beefy and herbal notes among the more standard black raspberry and plum fruit flavors. Medium-full on the palate with a hint of sanguine character, this comes off a bit brighter and more balanced than one might anticipated from the bouquet.",Fernand Averoux,87,30.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Minervois,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine Sainte Léocadie
Australia,"Mixed aromas of vanilla, Christmas spices and brandied black cherries give an almost dessert-like impression, although the wine is technically dry.

Drink now–2012.",Luchador,89,19.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz,R Wines
Portugal,"The two Ramos-Pinto quintas of Ervamoira and Bons Ares provide contrasting fruit—the hot, dry conditions of Ervamoira and the more temperate climate of Bons Ares.

The tannins are strong but finely ground. Appeals now for sheer beauty.",Revilo Vineyard,90,85.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Carter
Argentina,"This old-timer proves that Argentinean Malbec is not a great cellar dweller. This smells, tastes and feels much older than its eight years. It's full of tobacco, dried spices and a dominating leafiness. The blend is 70% Syrah and 30% Malbec.",Linea Tonel,82,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Finca La Anita
France,"From organically cultivated grapes, this fresh but bone-dry wine shows delicious pink grapefruit, ripe juicy pear skins and a hint of caramel and yeast. With its extra weight, this is on the food side of sparkling wines, leaving structured freshness.",Exception Brut Nature,87,30.0,Burgundy,Crémant de Bourgogne,,Champagne Blend,Bailly-Lapierre
US,"Although this Zin is fully dry, it's too soft in acidity, giving a flatness to the blackberry, cherry, licorice and spice flavors. Give it a bit more structure, and the score would soar.",Live Oak,85,25.0,California,Contra Costa County,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Cline

There are herbal nuances that have been nurtured and preserved rather than obliterated with new oak, and the wine has an elegant balance.",,89,26.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Gilbert Cellars
Italy,"This offers loads of freshly ground peppercorn, backed by touches of caper and black olive. The blackberry and plum fruits gives this wine a soft, yielding feel despite the tannins. The fruit is sourced from vineyards at various altitudes on Mt. Vulture.",Grifalco,88,14.0,Southern Italy,Aglianico del Vulture,,Aglianico,Lucania
Italy,"Here's a pretty, easy-drinking wine that reveals aromas of Granny Smith apple, hay and hints of exotic fruit that carry over to the palate. The ripe fruit is brightened by fresh acidity that leaves a clean finish.",,86,29.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Grigio,Franz Haas
US,"Airfield reds are thoroughly saturated with color, and often quite tannic, to the detriment of the lighter, more subtle fruit. This wine loses its definition and turns from pretty to pretty harsh as a result.",Spitfire Dolcetto-Primitivo-Sangiovese,84,24.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Airfield Estates
US,"Soft and rich in texture, this has flavors that are as intricately wound as a tapestry: blackberries and cassis to green olive tapenade, cedar and a slight, but appealing, funkiness, suggestive of worn leather.

US,"There's lots of richness to this Cabernet, a testimony to the sunny ripeness of the vintage.

Chile,"La Rosa's first-ever prestige wine is a burly blend of Cab Sauvignon, Carmenère, Syrah and Cab Franc.

US,"This is very pretty and lightly floral, with lilac, sweet cream and bourbon barrel scents mixed in with the sweet cherry fruit. Right now the barrel flavors tend to overpower the fruit, giving the finish a hard, slightly alcoholic edge. With more time, fruit will re-emerge—it's quite pretty cherry flavored; clean and precise, polished but not at all fat or jammy.",Boushey,89,46.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Forgeron
US,"Try giving this Pinot Noir 5–6 years in the cellar. It's not that it's undrinkable now, but it's immature, offering just a hint of what it wants to be. The fruit is ripe and jammy, suggesting red cherries and pomegranates, and the acidity is juicy and tart.

US,"Concentrated and showing a whiff of volatility, this is a blend of 62% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and a splash each of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. Grapes are sourced from three different estate vineyards on Red Mountain.

Spain,"Can't-miss aromas of petrol, wet stones and lime will have you thinking this is Riesling, but the blend is two-thirds Garnacha Blanca and the rest Macabeo.

Could do interesting things over the years.",Rosella's Vineyard,90,36.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Morgan
Chile,"This absurdly priced Carmenère is always one of Chile's best, and this vintage is just fine, with cherry, cassis, graphite, herb and eucalyptus-like green aromas.

You can be the judge.",Kai,90,235.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Errazuriz

Chile,"A blend of old-vine Cariñena (60%), Syrah (25%) and Merlot (15%). The color is impressively dark and so is the fruit—mainly plums and blackberries. Toast and dried spices from new oak give an additional impression of opulence. But even more impressive is the balance. This is no low-acid, fruit-and-oak wonder; the natural acidity of the Carignane shines through, giving lift and definition to the flavors. Easy to drink now, but should easily hold a few years.",Cordillera,91,26.0,Curicó Valley,,,Red Blend,Miguel Torres

US,"This is a fine companion wine to Hogue's less-expensive “regular” Chardonnay. It shows the same luscious, tropical/citrus fruit flavors, the added layers of caramel and vanilla, the spicy finish.

US,"There's something Chablisian about this Chardonnay. It's partly the acidity, which is high, and partly the gunmetal minerality, courtesy of another cool vintage in the southern Napa/Carneros region where the grapes were grown.

Germany,"Shows ample complexity on the nose, offering up hints of dried apricot and crushed stone to go alongside dominant notes of superripe apple.

France,"While wood aging is an integral part of fine Bordeaux, with this wine it is just too much. While it is young, the wood, raw and dominant, submerges the fruit to give a wine that is dense, very dry and hard at the edges. It's not likely to ever lose this quality.",,84,26.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château du Cartillon

Chile,"Pretty nice wine, with a good aromatic mix of green fruits, grassiness and light mineral.

Spain,"Clear and focused, with raspberry and edgy spice aromas to the nose. The palate doesn't bring a whole bunch of meat or heft, but it is clean, racy and food-friendly.

Generally a workaday, inexpensive Italian red, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is a good pizza/pasta choice. It's not to be confused with the Tuscan Montepulciano.

US,"This Pinot, which was grown on the Hanzell estate, is described by the winery as a barrel selection made to drink now.

Spain,"Aromas of cherry-chocolate and rubber are firm and a little closed. And such a bouquet doesn't really portend a flavor profile dominated by pink grapefruit and tight citrus.

US,"This is one of Von Strasser's newer bottlings, with the grapes planted only in 2001. It is a designation to watch for its intensity, purity and longevity. Enormously focused in black currants, dark chocolate and moo shu plum sauce, it shows the hard tannins of a young Diamond Mountain Cab.

Argentina,"Lightly baked and sweet on the nose, which draws you in. The palate is brighter and more austere, with sheer, slightly bland cherry and raspberry flavors. Fresh, clean and bouncy on the finish, but never does it turn the corner toward greater complexity or quality. Good to average overall.",,85,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Dante Robino
US,"A single-vineyard, single-varietal wine, the Crawford Vineyard Malbec showcases the pleasure and power of the grape as it is being grown in Washington. Structurally it has the grip and precision of a Cabernet, with a pretty, lightly herbal side that runs more to green tea than to Cabernet's black olive. The fruit is tart and spicy, suggesting rhubarb, wild strawberry and cranberry, but as the wine opens up it puts on flesh and more layers.",Crawford Vineyard,89,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Malbec,Camaraderie

The '02 Merlot, mainly from Beckstoffer Vineyard X, has been held back longer than most, allowing it to soften and fatten.

US,"Solidly in the Rosenblum style, a soft, high-alcohol wine, low in acids and tannins, high in the deliciousness factor.

Drink 2008–2015.",Coonawarra Estate Terra Rossa First Growth,91,70.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Parker
Portugal,"This is a finely integrated, rich wine that shows impeccable balance between dusty tannins and juicy dark berry tones. The wood aging shows through in a smooth texture that gives a sense of richness to the ripe fruit. This is an elegant wine that can be drunk now although it will benefit from some aging. Drink from 2017.",Periquita Reserva,90,16.0,Península de Setúbal,,,Portuguese Red,José Maria da Fonseca
US,"A good wine for the price, crisp and clean and minerally. The flavors are of tart citrus fruits such as Meyer lemons and limes, white peaches and vanilla. A finish of sugar mars what otherwise should be a completely dry wine.",Las Brisas Vineyard,85,13.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Vermentino,Mahoney
Argentina,"Textbook Malbec with a nice, modern package. Solid as you'd expect, with plum/berry aromas, a hint of cherry candy and then a drawn, mildly saucy palate of red fruit. Good mouthfeel, nothing abrasive, and competent on the finish.",Urban Uco,86,11.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,O. Fournier
Cyprus,"A unique wine, this has sweet aromas of honeysuckle, mint and oak. Low in acidity with a medium body, it gives the impression of oiliness, and has strange muscat-like flavors with oak and sawdust hints.",,80,10.0,Lemesos,,,Xinisteri,Domaine Nicolaides
US,"This tangy, tasty wine has strong elements of citrus and tobacco, both indicative of top-tier Washington Syrah. Take one swallow and the flavors keep piling on. Candied citrus and sweet berry and white pepper and clove, a three ring circus of a wine. But it's not overblown, and it's all in proportion. The fruit is the star, as it should be.",,94,30.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Kontos

US,"The 2005 vintage was kind to this wine, grown in the warmer, northerly Middle Reach section of the valley. While lacking the depth of the 2002 and 2003, it shows flavorful black currants, cherries and root beer, with a peppery finish. The tannins are rich and fine. Small additions of Zin, Malbec, Petite Sirah and other red varieties add complexity.",DaKine Vineyard,89,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
Spain,"Smoky, rubbery and suggestive of bacon and toast on the nose. The palate is more crisp and snappy, with juicy flavors of red currant, cherry and spice.

US,"An acidic, minerally Chardonnay  showing structure, cleanliness and elegance. Richness comes by way of intense limes, as well as the usual complexities of new oak and lees aging, and there is not the slightest suggestion of sweetness.

France,"Acquired in 2006 by Alain-Dominique Perrin of Lagrézette, Clos Marguerite is situated on the top terrace above the Lot.

US,"Made from 100% Syrah and aged in half new French oak, this brawny Syrah hails from a vineyard known for its mix of power and finesse.

US,"A lovely Cabernet, rich and ripe in blackberries and cassis, with a touch of herbs and a little heat from high alcohol. A good steak, with its salty fattiness, will take care of that. But it's tannic. Not so much that you can't drink it now, but it really wants a year or two in the cellar.",District Collection,91,75.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Raymond

US,"This bottling has been variable over the years, sometimes great, sometimes merely good. The challenging 2011 vintage has yielded something in the middle. The wine is nicely dry and silky in texture, yet it has real weight in the raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors. Doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink now–2016.",Mesa,89,48.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Riverbench
Austria,"For an ice wine, this is relatively rich. But it certainly doesn't take away from the pure acidity that lifts the sweet fruit, giving the ripe peach and dried apricot flavors a great frame. It is ready to drink now, but another year and it will be even better focused.",Eiswein,90,52.0,Burgenland,,,Grüner Veltliner,Höpler

Italy,"This lavishly oaked wine with a big fruit foundation is very much in the California style, though it is made in Piedmont.

US,"This is blended from two finished wines: a 2005 Counoise (64%) and a 2006 Viognier (36%). It's ripe and round and showing strawberry and peach flavors. The two grapes work together well, and create a seamless wine with plenty of fruit power.",Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Vin,86,18.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Rosé,McCrea
US,"This is a successful straight-ahead Chardonnay, with aromas of buttercream, vanilla and orange cake developing complexity thanks to alkaline, pithy notes.

It has vibrant citrus in the mouth, with cantaloupe and a hint of vanilla from older oak. The aromas are similar, with some honeysuckle, while the body is full and creamy, despite racy acids.

Australia,"This has been a consistently excellent offering over recent vintages, combining Shiraz, Cabernet and Merlot to good effect.

France,"Yves Gras is one of the appellation's standard bearers, and this mid-level bottling doesn't disappoint. He's toned down the use of oak in recent years, allowing more black cherry fruit to shine, matched by hints of grilled meat, mocha and black olive. It's full-bodied, mouthfilling and harmonious, with a long, supple finish.",Aux Lieux-Dits,91,50.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine Santa Duc

US,"A to Z is on the money once again with this screwcapped Chardonnay, tight but flavorful with mixed tree fruits and more exotic notes of quince and kiwi.

France,"Made from 70–80-year-old estate-grown vines, this boasts a tremendously complex and seductive bouquet of smoke, violets, raspberries and blackberries.

US,"Made in the Heirloom style, which is huge, extracted and potent. The '07 shows the preternatural ripeness of the vintage, offering massive cherry and black raspberry fruit, along with sizable tannins. The winemaker has framed this power with considerable oak.

Argentina,"With floral aromas, toasty oak notes and solid berry fruit, this bottling is the best among Trapiche's 2007 single-vineyard Malbecs.

Spain,"Right from the start you know this wine is challenged. The nose is lean and green, with hints of tea and citrus peel. In the mouth, it's snappy and traditional, meaning there's American oak dill notes brushing up against rhubarb and red cherry.

Spain,"Slightly low on kick and bubbles for a blanc de blancs, but the wine's mix of green herb, apple, green banana and melon flavors is good and offers the proper set up to a finish that's citrusy as can be and only slightly pithy. Seems a touch flat or it might have rated even higher.",Brut Blanc de Blancs,87,18.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau

US,"This sparkler is 100% Chardonnay and is clearly the star of the Domaine Ste. Michelle lineup. Generously toasty, with the sort of finesse found in Champagne.

New Zealand,"The 2004 vintage wasn't that kind to Marlborough Pinot Noir, but the country's largest winery has managed to turn in a solid effort with their top wine.

Chile,"Definitely on the ripe side, but a very pleasing wine. This is a low-acid wine that obviously caught a lot of sun in the vineyard, thus it goes soft on the tannins and light on the bite.

US,"Although basically an earthy wine that was most likely produced from vineyards where the yields were stretched to the max to keep the price down, it does have its charms.

Rhone-styled, perhaps, on the palate, with a cracked-pepper quality accenting the black fruit; there's a lifted quality—the Viognier's floral notes—to the black cherry fruit, that feels overdone. This is a tasty wine, to be sure, but one whose 6% Viognier is about 3% too much.",The Laughing Magpie Shiraz Viognier,88,35.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Red Blend,D'Arenberg
US,"A new offering made entirely from estate fruit, this is a selection of the best blocks and barrels of the vintage, with its core component being 90% Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon.

US,"Tastes jammy and sharp, like a barrel sample, with acidic flavors of raspberries, black cherries and spices. The tannins are rich and smooth. A very good wine, but bristly and tough in youth. Give it a few years to mellow.",Scherrer Vineyard,87,27.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Greenwood Ridge
US,"So dramatically deep in flavor, it immediately impresses for the depth of blackberries, cassis and minerals, enriched with sweet, smoky oak. The tannins are fierce now, and the wine shows a precocious immaturity that makes it somewhat coarse. But it clearly has the structure to age well. Should glide through the next dozen years with ease. Production was 875 cases.",Vintage V,94,110.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lamborn Family Vineyards
Argentina,"Despite being six years old, this is still kicking. The nose is raw and stewy, but it's also ripe and rubbery, with cassis and berry aromas.

One-dimensional but not bad for Argentine Cab.",Limited Reserve,86,24.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña El Cerno

US,"A bit rustic and rowdy, in the way of Malbec, with big, edgy tannins and a scour of acidity.

US,"No doubt about it, this is a big, lusty Pinot Noir. From a low-production parcel of the estate, it routinely produces immensely concentrated wines. The winemaker's challenge is to give balance and harmony to grapes of this heft, and here, Iron Horse has it figured out. Dry and enormously ripe in cherries, black raspberries, cocoa and cola, it's good now with lamb chops, grilled steaks and similar upscale fare, and should soften and improve for five years.",Thomas Road,95,70.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse

New Zealand,"Syrah is quickly gaining popularity in Hawke's Bay and this is a good example why. Reminiscent of a Crozes-Hermitage, this wine's meaty, peppery aromas and blackberry-boysenberry fruit aren't overpowering, just nicely balanced and very drinkable over the near term.",Gimblett Road,90,19.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Syrah,CJ Pask
US,"This blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Charbono and Syrah is rustic and sturdy. It shows oaky flavors of blackberries, tobacco, mocha and spice, and finishes a bit soft and sweet. Good with a rich, slow food dish like braised short ribs.",Scout's Honor,86,38.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Venge

Argentina,"Spicy and woody at first, with tons of black fruit. The nose shows a hint of dill, but for the most part the wine's pure and full of plum, blackberry, vanilla and good tannins.

US,"A definitive, whitepepper spice note runs through many, if not most Oregon Pinot Blancs. It's a positive marker, and this wine is a fine example.

US,"From a new winery focused on Bordeaux-style blends, this is 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 39% Merlot, with a splash of Cab Franc. Pondera is a bit ponderous, up at 15% alcohol (at least) and betting the farm on fruit and oak. If that's your style, this may suit you, although with Washington fruit you get a fair amount of acid rather than the generous breadth of the ripest California Cabs.",Consensio Red Wine,86,33.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Pondera

US,"A rustic, French countryside kind of a wine, this is deliciously reflective of a cooler vintage and the nuances the variety can display in the right hands.

Italy,"Charred-earth, espresso, French oak and menthol aromas unfold on this full-bodied red while a plum note lingers in the background.

Assertive, close grained tannins provide the bracing framework.",Riserva,87,30.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Red Blend,Mangiacane

Chile,"As funky a white wine as you're likely to find in Chile, with lean flavors that veer toward pickles and veggies. Maybe it's already losing it because it seems lost. Mouthfeel, however, is an attribute that keeps it afloat.",Secreto,82,12.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Viognier,Viu Manent

US,"This is 80% Cabernet and 20% Merlot, and hits just 12.6% alcohol—unusually low. It tastes a bit thin, either young vines or high yields or both.

US,"A beautiful Riesling, perfect for a cocktail or with a wide range of fare. Bone dry and richly acidic, it shows true varietal flavors of citrus, honeysuckle, diesel or lighter fluid, minerals and gardenia flower. This is a wine that sommeliers should scoop up, but only 450 cases were produced.",,90,15.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Riesling,Brass Tacks

Argentina,"Opens with earthy, leafy aromas that can best be described as “mature.” Throw in tobacco and baked plum, and the picture is complete.

New Zealand,"Production (and pricing) of this wine have moved up considerably since 2005, when it represented a pretty good value at $23.

US,"This newest version of the vineyard's signature block of Syrah has more forward, sweet fruit than any before; and it also brings pretty chocolate-wrapped tannins into the picture.

Italy,"The Cannubi Boschis cru (also known as Monghisolfo) is known for the excellent quality of its fruit.

US,"Firm and lush, the blend also includes 12% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon. This is a bigger, more expansive style than the regular Syrah, but still a fine value.

US,"Sharp, earthy and herbal, this has more guts than most Sangioveses—that's the good news—but it doesn't suggest much of what you might consider true varietal character. It's relatively dark for Sangio, and it's a chewy, earthy red wine with some light and tart berry and cherry fruit flavors. A good spaghetti red.",,85,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sangiovese,Maryhill

Spain,"Hay, corn and buttered toast are the initial aromas, and soon after the wine settles into a pretty good groove.

This wine handles its sugar like a pro.",Semi-Seco,87,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
US,"A true sensation. Shows the richness and concentration you want in a great Napa Cab, but also a structure that lifts it above the soft, mushy wines that are so prevalent. There's real tannin and acid architecture framing the opulent blackberry, black currant, mineral and cedar flavors, and the finish is dry, dry, dry. Every sip offers something different as it changes in the glass. A world-class wine that defines elegance, power and complexity. Should age effortlessly for at least a decade.",16 Rows,97,150.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vine Cliff
US,"Rich, full-bodied and heavy, this is dramatic in its own way. It's certainly ripe and thick, with a flavor of black raspberry jam and a touch of milk chocolate.

US,"This is lovely Syrah, stripped of flash and barrel, showing pure fruit that has zip and true character.

Italy,"This is a tight, compact and slightly nervous Sangiovese-Canaiolo blend from Umbria that emits loads of intensity and aromatic energy: Forest berry, blueberries violets, leather, nuts and spicy cinnamon all come to mind. It's an easy wine with a streamlined mouthfeel and a touch of thorny sourness on the finish. The natural acidity would make an excellent companion to most pasta dishes.",Rubesco,87,15.0,Central Italy,Torgiano,,Red Blend,Lungarotti
US,"A spectacular Pinot Noir, but a very young one, and extremely dry. It's a wine of great structure, with rich acids and tannins framing extraordinarily complex flavors of grilled cherries, strawberries and raspberries, with complicating notes of cola, pomegranates, orange zest, anise, dusty Asian spices and smoky sandalwood. A truly great Pinot Noir from a great vintage that needs time in the bottle to express itself. The vineyard, which is owned by the winery, is only 19 acres, planted to an array of newer and older clones.

France,"This is a full-flavored, round and spicy ready-to-go bottle of bubbly. The LeRoy Neiman graphics and cava-style bottle suggest party time, and the flavors are right up against banana-ish tropicality.

Spain,"Lightly stemmy and brambly, with lean red fruit aromas, a touch of saline and red licorice candy. The palate is lean and sort of scratchy, while the flavors are suggestive of red apple skins and red plum. Tight on the finish; similar is some ways to a simple Chianti.",Crianza,85,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
Hungary,"This red is appealing for its honesty, with scents of fresh grapes and wet black earth. It turns a bit perfumed in the mouth but has a solid finish, supported by good acidity and gentle tannins. Drink now.",Portugieser,85,15.0,Villány,,,Red Blend,Gere Attila
Australia,"Black ash, cedar and crushed raspberries are the aromas here, while an underlying note of wet earth keeps things grounded. The palate has a sweet cherry cordial character while the short finish offers up a hit of mixed berry soup. Drink up.",,84,12.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Razor's Edge
New Zealand,"Wonderfully forward and fruity, this is simply a delight to taste. Apple and lime aromas are rounded out by just a hint of peach, while the flavors of ripe peaches and apples are kept focused by stabs of citrus. Medium-bodied, with a touch of sweetness to balance the crisp acids, this would make a great apéritif.",Cellar Selection,90,19.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Villa Maria
New Zealand,"Pleasant enough, but the lime and grapefruit flavors are a bit dilute. Lacks intensity overall; well chilled, the mild flavors would make a nice counterpoint to strongly flavored foods.",Winemaker's Private Bin,83,18.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Corbans
US,"Young and spicy, this easy-drinking Pinot Gris still shows some bite and some bitterness, perhaps from skin contact. Give it a little more bottle age, and drink it chilled, to bring out the tart fruit and cut the phenolics.",,86,19.0,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,Pinot Gris,Corvallis Cellars
Argentina,"For the price, this is pretty good. Not very Syrah-like, but if you enjoy plum, cherry and currant flavors along with pretty good mouthfeel and balance, you'll get it here.",Uma,84,6.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Shiraz,Telteca
US,"A high-acid, weighty and complex white, this vintage is even better than the last, gorgeous in a golden tannish color. Tropical guava and white flowers weave seamlessly through a web of minerality and freshness, without compromising body and texture. This is a delicious wine.",Wayfarer Vineyard,95,80.0,California,Fort Ross-Seaview,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Wayfarer
Italy,"Low key aromas concentrate on peach and melon with some exotic fruit. In the mouth, the wine is supple and graceful, but it's also rather neutral. Try it with falafel. Imported by Italian Wine Growers.",,85,16.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Pinot Grigio,Cormòns
Italy,"There's a tiny touch of volatility here that comes forth aromatically as apple cider or mature raspberry. Often those pungent, vertical notes help elevate and define a wine, not necessarily in a negative manner, and that seems to be the case here.",Monpissano Riserva,85,48.0,Piedmont,Roero,,Nebbiolo,Cascina Cà Rossa
US,"The vineyard is on the Carneros border, and this Chard has lots of juicy acidity, which may also be due to the winemaker picking the grapes at a relatively low ripeness level. The pepper- and mineral-infused flavors suggest peaches and grapefruits, enriched with new oak and lees. This is an extremely dry, food-friendly wine.",Rhinefarm Vineyard,87,25.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gundlach Bundschu
US,"This is a blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon. It's full-bodied and ripely sweet in fruit, in the manner of a Paso Robles red wine. What it may lack in subtlety, it more than makes up in sheer power. Floods the mouth with blackberries, cherries, currants, plums, mocha, violets, leather, tobacco and pepper spice. Now–2012.",,92,52.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blend,Treana

US,"Though less expensive than the Artisan series releases from Foundry, the Alla Prima seems better balanced. There's less new oak (though 40% is not insubstantial) and the alcohol is well under 15%. The wine weaves together cherry, dark chocolate and espresso with plenty of tart acidity to buoy it up.",Alla Prima,89,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Foundry Vineyards
Italy,"Shows unexpected age, with brown around the edges and mature prune and orange-peel aromas. The flavors are more alive, but are not vibrant.

Argentina,"Airy floral notes and a whiff of strawberry on the nose give this wine a lighter outlook, yet the palate is still fairly full-bodied as it offers ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors.

Italy,"The Vigna Gattera cru produces elegant wines with immediate floral notes of blue flower and violet. Those aromas are followed by red fruit and spice with distant smoke and mineral. This wine is very much enhanced by the beauty of its mouthfeel, which is silky. Delicious.",Vigna Gattera,91,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Gianfranco Bovio
US,"This is taut, muscular, toasty, young and tight; the fruit is concentrated, pure and evocative, with earthy flavors that add notes of soil, spice and mineral. The most complex of all the Betz blends, in this vintage it includes 84% Cabernet Sauvignon—far and away the dominant flavor. The fruits unfold in a rich panoply of reds and blues; the tannins are rich and chewy, polished and complex, showing exemplary back of the palate grip and concentration.",Père de Famille,96,58.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Betz Family
Italy,"Impeccably balanced and extremely elegant, this opens with a multifaceted fragrance of perfumed berry, crushed blue flower, menthol, baking spice and just a hint of new leather. The graceful palate offers layers of succulent wild cherry, white pepper, licorice, mint and eucalyptus alongside firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's sleek and already tempting but hold for complexity. Drink 2016–2030.",San Lorenzo Gran Selezione,95,52.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Red Blend,Castello di Ama
Australia,"A wine that combines pretty black-cherry fruit with cinnamon, earth and mushrooms. The fruit is pleasant enough, but the emphasis is on the earthier side of Pinot—soil and mulch and bark; some herbal flavors chime in on the finish. Might improve with mid-term cellaring.",,88,22.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Pinot Noir,Yering Station
US,"On opening, the oak on this Carneros Chard was overwhelming in smoke and char, giving the pear, Meyer lemon and kiwi flavors a woody undertow. As it breathes, it softens and unifies, but it's still a Hulk of a wine.",Lot 57,85,12.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Cameron Hughes
US,"Tasted right after bottling, this new release from the high-profile Ste. Michelle/Antinori Red Mountain project may be the finest Col Solare to date. The blend is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, and a splash each of Cabernet Franc and Petite Verdot. Half is Horse Heaven Hills fruit, one quarter Cold Creek and one quarter Wahluke Slope. This is a chewy, muscular wine, dense with plummy fruit, and layered with flavors of earth, soy and black tea. There is a hint of baked, pruney flavor that is restrained enough to add interest rather than detract.",Red Table Wine,92,75.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Col Solare

Give this wine two or three more years of bottle aging to find harmony.",,88,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore Nizza,,Barbera,Bersano
France,"There are mere hints of beeswax and marzipan on the nose. The palate opens into a structured, bright and well-lit space of pear peel, pear juice and a wonderfully bitter edge. This is off-dry and concentrated, definite but with a light touch. There is an intriguing hint of bitter orange peel that draws you in and pull this onto a higher plane.",Kessler Grand Cru,92,30.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Domaines Schlumberger

France,"This is a powerfully tannic wine from a blend of equal proportions of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with a serious touch of Petit Verdot.

US,"Stolpman grows its Sangiovese in an area of the Santa Ynez Valley where most producers specialize in Rhône varieties. The result is often one of the most interesting California interpretations of the great Tuscan grape.

France,"Very ripe, powerful and extracted, the wine has a bitter edge, a dark and tannic structure and a dense texture.

US,"This is a new vineyard from the owners of Bien Nacido, located within sight of the Pacific. The vines are young but promising. This low-production Pinot is dry and racy as the latest clones have given it huge, pure cherry pie, raspberry, cocoa and Fig Newton flavors. Hard to imagine a more delicious young Pinot.

US,"All kinds of fantastic things swirl together in this complex, intricate Pinot Noir, but it's too young to touch for a while. The '09 vintage was a great one for Arista's Pinots, and this bottling is their best, a small-production blend of four vineyards. Purists will object that it's a little too forward in sweet fruit, but the raspberries and cherries have interesting cola and mushroom complexities that sing of the soil, while lots of new oak adds rich layers of toast. Beautiful, but needs 4–5 years to begin to come around.",Two Birds,94,68.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
Australia,"Not impressive out of the gate—a pithy, stalky note dominates the palate.

Spain,"Fizzy and foamy and aggressive. To give it a frame of reference, it is similar to Brachetto or Frascati from Italy, but it's clumsy on the palate and tastes too much like red licorice and candied fruit to be taken too seriously.

US,"This is all Lewis Vineyard Cabernet, though not as strong as the vineyard-designated bottling from the same vintage. There is noticeable volatility in the opening aromas, which slowly blows off and turns into concentrated raspberry, boysenberry, plum and cherry compote fruit. Dense and buoyed with firm acids, this wine needs a full 24 hours to smooth out. There is plenty of well-managed oak, adding smoky coffee and espresso to the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon X,90,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dunham

US,"A beautiful Bordeaux blend, rich and flavorful, brimming with blackberries, black currants, black cherries, herbs and new oak. Feels fine and elegant in the mouth. Ready now for its elegant approachability, but has the tannic structure to age through 2014.

The mouthfeel is smooth, elegant and the finish is long.",Gallina,93,,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Ugo Lequio
US,"This is the winery's complement to the Grâce reserve, and the best of the new releases. Had I to choose, I'd give the nod to the Elégance.

The ‘05 is especially layered, showing a silky, elegant mouthfeel that frames extraordinarily lush flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates, root beer and dusty Asian spices.

US,"Poet's Leap was the first wine to be released under the Long Shadows portfolio, and this 2005 is clearly its best yet. Old-vine Riesling from Dionysus and Weinbau form the core of the wine, which is immaculate, rich and generous. The fruits sound like a county fair in summer—melon, stone fruits, citrus, honey—and the mix of residual sugar (about 1.6%) and racy acids is thrillingly on target.",,93,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Poet's Leap

Drink this already maturing Central Otago Pinot over the next year or two.",,88,40.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Prophet's Rock
US,"This is the grandest of Melville's current trio of '06s. It's also the most ageworthy. Fifty percent stem inclusion in the fermentation has given the wine a tannic, gritty earthiness and spiciness that throw a cloak over the underlying wine. But what a fantastic wine that is, loaded with oodles of cherries, currants and violets. Hard to exaggerate the complexity and broad intellectual appeal of this connoisseur's wine.",Estate Carrie's,95,52.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Melville

Italy,"A well-oaked specimen, one with sandalwood, hickory, coffee and Middle Eastern spice notes on the nose. Big and generous with its plum, berry and thick but slick oak flavors.

The intensity is present but not overdone.",Guidalberto,89,55.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Tenuta San Guido
US,"Lovely aromatics mix floral, fruit and barrel components in equal proportion. The wine has some solid tannins, and sits in the mouth with a bit of gravitas.

Definitely a wine to age a few more years.",Flat Block Estate,89,,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Bethel Heights

Spain,"Lemony and light on the bouquet. The palate is aggressive, almondy tasting and tight, with lemony lead flavors, peach notes and a lasting but not unpleasant bitterness. Nicely balanced, with good mouthfeel. A very nice wine and a different breed within the wide world of Spanish white wines.",Calitja,88,15.0,Catalonia,Terra Alta,,Garnacha Blanca,Celler La Bollidora

Chile,"Solid and full-bodied, with thoroughness to the nose. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, pepper and savory spice are totally convincing, while the finish is tight and right if not exactly effusive.

Imported by Five Star Imports.",Vieilles Vignes,89,20.0,Requinoa,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Château Los Boldos
Moldova,"This is the best of Cricova's Collection series, which consists of wines that age in the winery for years. It has an evolved nose of aged cheese, earth, stem and tobacco, with some fruit to spare. Fairly light for a Cabernet, it maintains healthy, yet dusty, tannins supporting barnyard, leather, brown spice and chewing tobacco flavors. The fruit has gone, but what remains is an interesting, complex wine with good intensity.",Collection Cabernet,86,23.0,Moldova,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cricova
US,"The blend is classic Bordeaux—85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. It's got grip and a sensuous mix of wild herb, black olive and mountain berry. There is plenty of acid to support it, and winemaker J-F Pellet has been pulling back on the new oak, so that newer releases of Pepper Bridge are more structured and tilting more toward a European sensibility, which is to say, ageworthy.",,92,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pepper Bridge
New Zealand,"A bigger, richer wine than Te Awa Farm's Longlands Cabernet blend, this Merlot is packed with black-cherry and chocolate aromas and flavors.

Try in 2003 if you can wait that long.",Longlands,88,16.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Merlot,Te Awa Farm
Spain,"Aromas of cured meat, earthy plum and dry berry fruits are composed and harmonious. This mature wine feels firm and a touch grating, while ripe flavors of blackberry and plum are borderline baked. On the finish, a chocolaty flavor and modest depth are solid but don't amplify the wine. Drink now.",,89,25.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Tempranillo,Yemaserena
Germany,"Intriguing, with Indian spice and petroleum top notes followed by pomelo and lime fruit. There's density to the citrus fruit and an overall elegance.

US,"This is a pretty wine, and the initial flavors are soft and mature, suggesting a wine that's ready to drink now. In the mouth it falls away quickly with a slightly oxidized character that suggests an early fade is on the way. It's gentle and drinks well enough right now, with some barrel notes of caramel and coffee beefing up the finish.",Nicholas Estate,86,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Anam Cara

Spain,"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous.

US,"Dark, dense, ripe and oaky, this ramps up the oak flavors to higher levels, with rich layers of smoke, cedar, honey and butterscotch wrapped into the spicy, sweet fruit.

France,"Rather reined-in on the nose, this wine lacks Gewürz's over-the-top aromatics, instead showing restrained pear and spice scents.

Chile,"Light on the nose, with strawberry, cola and a cheesy undertone to the bouquet. The body here is pretty trim and fresh, while the flavors are of slightly reedy red fruit, vanilla and cream.

While the obvious spice of the Gewürztraminer is subdued by the richness and sweetness, it still has all the fat, opulent character of the grape.

US,"Bone dry, toasty, forward, and tart. The flavors orient themselves around a bright core of blueberry fruit.

A strong streak of licorice and smoke weaves through the finish.",,92,60.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sangiovese,Leonetti Cellar

South Africa,"The nose of this Chard is so lively and welcoming with accents of lilac, jasmine, white peach slices and clementine. Matured in barrel for 10 months, the wine's palate offers more intense, mature flavors of peaches and cream, ginger and supporting tropical acidity. Well structured with a defined and evolving finish, it takes you from citrus to fresh peach to vanilla wooded spice.",DMZ,88,15.0,Western Cape,,,Chardonnay,DeMorgenzon

Italy,"A crowd-pleasing, Chard-based sparkler with freshness, a lively personality and generous aromas of pear and kiwi fruit.

There's just enough acidity here and a refreshing hit of lemon on the finish. Drink now.",,87,16.0,South Australia,Limestone Coast,,Chardonnay,TLC
Chile,"Overall this is one concentrated, hefty, grapey youngster that's unfiltered and untamed. The palate is lush, heavy and tannic, while the flavors are grapey and saturated.

Turkey,"Red violet in the glass, this blend of 85% Öküzgözü and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon has a nose of butterscotch and black cherry.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Diatom
US,"Easily one of the greatest California Merlots ever. Notable for its complete balance. Nothing sticks out; all the parts work together. The black cherry, plum, black currant, dark chocolate and licorice fruit is big, but perfectly balanced with smoky, sweet oak, while a subtle touch of violets brings a smack of the earth. The tannin-acid structure is just beautiful. Will continue to develop bottle complexity for at least six more years.",Reserve,96,90.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Chateau St. Jean

Harlan,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Calera
Spain,"Baked, earthy and leathery, just like all the AN wines. But there's also a smooth intersection of the old and new worlds here; it's one part rooty, oaky and rich but also dry, leathery and indigenous to the Balearics (the base grape is Callet). Finishes a little sweet and warm, and thus it's begging to be drunk now.",Àn,89,50.0,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
Spain,"Mildly burnt smelling, with whiffs of charred toast and forest fire. Plenty of black cherry, plum and brown sugar comprise the palate, which is also laden with licorice and spice.

France,This is a stylish wine with a touch of minerality as well as acidity. It is light in character with a tangy texture and fine pure fruits. The wine is ripe while never excessive.

France,"It's worth noting the sec (dry) note on the label, because this is bone-dry Chenin. It does, though, have enough richness to bring a fine balance, with crisp apples, a mineral and steel character, and a taut-as-a-string texture. Drink now, or age for 2–3 years.",Sec,89,18.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,,Chenin Blanc,Laurent Kraft

France,"From start to finish, this top quality vintage follows a straight line. It starts with freshness and explodes into richness. The initial very tight structure soon opens out with white pears and green plums, soft and ripe. The fruit is supported by the structure which offers orange zest.

France,"An excellent wine from Côtes du Roussillon Villages, offering yummy aromas of berry preserves, milk chocolate and fresh coffee granules.

It's bone dry, light and silky in the mouth, and crisp in acidity, a lovely, elegant Pinot Noir with modest alcohol that feels just fine. The flavors are of cherries, cola and pomegranates. Beautiful now, and should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",Maritime,93,54.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
US,"With its slightly drying tannins and firm finish, this is a steakhouse Merlot, not a soft, easy sipper to drink on its own, yet it's not overpowering in weight.

Distinguished, but not an ager. Now–2011.",,91,90.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Pahlmeyer
US,"This is a fine companion wine to Hogue's less-expensive “regular” Chardonnay. It shows the same luscious, tropical/citrus fruit flavors, the added layers of caramel and vanilla, the spicy finish.

US,"Dark as midnight and very tannic and dry, this 100% Cabernet is somewhat forbidding in its turbulent youth. It's very astringent and chewy, and the palate has to work to bite through to the core of blackberries, black cherries and cassis.

Give it at least until 2012 and try again.",State Lane Ranch,92,90.0,California,Yountville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nickel & Nickel

France,"Boasts some interesting aromas of clove and black pepper, balanced by blackberry and cherry flavors. Nicely proportioned and well structured, with mild tannins and decent acidity; it's not a blockbuster—just a satisfying accompaniment to simply prepared red meats.

Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors.

Chile,"With aromas of black fruit, earth, rubber and tomato leaf, this fits the bill for Carmenère. The palate is snappy and lively, with drying, rubbery tannins.

US,"Shows the classy elegance of all Qupe's Syrahs, although it's thinner and rougher than the more expensive bottlings. Still, for the price, this wine is nicely dry and intricate in blackberry and crushed pepper flavors.",,87,18.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Syrah,Qupé

The price is right, too.",Tian,89,20.0,Stellenbosch,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Umkhulu
France,"There is a definite richness to this wine, the ripe white fruit and melon flavors aided by a judicious amount of vanilla and toast.

US,"Master vintner Dick Arrowood has crafted a sensational wine from a sensational vintage. A blend from throughout the county, it shows his discernment in the overall balance, harmony and charm. Black currants, chocolate, green olives, sweet sage and vanilla-scented oak flavors come together in a lush, smooth, intricately structured wine that will probably hold for 10 years, but is best in its flamboyant, exuberant youth.",,93,45.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood

US,"This has 5% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend. It's done in all stainless steel; the Chardonnay is tight and spicy, with melon and apple flavors.

Good food wine.",Unoaked,87,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Boomtown

Decant for hours, or try the cellar, although that's a gamble.",South Mesa Barnwood Vineyard,85,25.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,La Fenêtre
Spain,"Smells waxy, as if it has slipped past its prime. The palate still sports a beam of bright acidity but there isn't much body or lees to accompany the richness, so the volume is low as a whole. Tastes good, but mostly like citrus and fresh fruit juice.",,87,19.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Fillaboa

Italy,"The toasted oak aromas are still evident on the nose, so give this a few more years to unwind before opening.

Germany,"Ultraripe tropical fruits—even including hints of bananas—dominate this wine's heady aromas. Acids are soft, and alcohol fairly elevated—12.5%—for a wine of this prädikat.

Italy,"Thanks to its plush and velvety nature, this is a wine with universal appeal. Barolo Bricco Sarmassa opens in big fashion with aromas of black cherry, Indian   spice, vanilla and dark espresso bean.

Spain,"Roll out the barrels! This is one heavily charred, very toasty number. At first the oak seems forced, and always is it front and center. But with some time in the cellar, today's dark, resiny bitterness should subside. At least we hope it does, because the wine has structure, density and pretty good fruit.

US,"Fans of CC will find a wine with the balance of previous vintages. It refuses to be a fruit bomb, but offers a wealth of sumptuous blackberry and cherry liqueur flavors that pull back at the last moment under a blanket of youthful tannins.

France,"Big and tannic, while at the same time potentially rich and smooth, this is, as always, an impressive wine. It has weight and dense texture.

US,"An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals. Brings to mind a great Chablis, with its zesty tang followed by elaborate layers of tropical fruits and pears.

Only 97 cases were produced.",Precioso,95,75.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
Italy,"Starts with a lot of creamy vanilla and berry perfume aromas, which don't really tip you off to the zesty, racy fruit that's been crammed onto the palate.

Spain,"Starts out on shaky ground with coconut and chemical aromas. In the mouth, it hits very hard with cola, raisin and cherry flavors.

Drink now through 2022.",Barrel Select,91,60.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Provenance Vineyards
US,"A tremendous wine that easily merits being Barnett's most expensive release.

France,"A lovely lemony lift jumps from the glass and immediately signals maturing Riesling. The palate is still taut with freshness but has the harmonious balminess of bottle age.

US,"A stunning Syrah, with a bit of Petite Sirah that seems to provide darkness, tannins and structure. Marked with black pepper aromas, it's extraordinarily rich in blackberry, blueberry and mocha flavors, with a mushroomy earthiness and sweet smoky oak influences. Full-bodied and dense now, it wants at least 3–5 years to come around.",Ballard Canyon Estate,93,36.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Rusack
US,"A very interesting Chardonnay, and easily worth the price.

Italy,"Made in a fuller style than is customary with Prosecco, with granular aromas of baked apple and peaches. The palate sports white peach and apple flavors, and the feel is one of roundness.

With the weight of the middle palate and the long, spicy finish, it's especially attractive, although it's also quite tannic. The only difference between this Estate Monte Bello Cabernet and Ridge's Monte Bello Estate Cabernet ($150; note the difference in the placement of ""estate"") is that the winemaker selected lots from the vineyard that were considered more accessible, which in this case means more luscious.

The fact that it's now more than five years old has helped to mellow it, but the tannins are still quite hard.

This sleek and beautifully proportioned wine has deep black cherry fruit, with smoky espresso flavors and moderately thick tannins. Substantial yet with appealing purity, it's a perfect steak wine and also one to stick in the cellar for a decade or so.",,91,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Januik
US,"A bit tough and gritty in texture, with some rugged tannins and a green streak that cuts through the cherry fruit. Will benefit from decanting, but doesn't seem likely to improve with age.",,86,35.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Senders
France,"Benefiting from the ripe 2009 vintage, the wine shows more ripe fruit than is usual from the Hautes-Côtes. It has rich strawberry flavor along with acidity. The soft tannins add a light sense of structure.",Les Forges,87,,Burgundy,Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune,,Pinot Noir,Pierre André
US,"You'll be surprised how much class there is in this inexpensive Chardonnay. It's rich in orange, pineapple and butterscotch flavors, while brisk acidity etches it in brightness. Finishes a little sweet, but you can stand this against many Chards that cost two or three times as much.",,86,7.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Hilltown
US,"This blend of all five Bordeaux varieties is consistently one of Beaulieu's most interesting but overlooked wines.

Australia,"This rather full-bodied offering from Leeuwin features some striking blueberry fruit, accompanied by notes of toast, vanilla and cedar. The result is a pleasant yin-yang of fruit and oak that likely just needs some time to develop more complexity. Try in 2012.",Art Series,90,35.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Shiraz,Leeuwin Estate
US,"One of the first wines of the new vintage, this nouveau-style wine is ultrafresh and fruity. It has peppy, zesty acidity and intense flavors of limes, kiwi, figs and vanilla. Utterly refreshing and dry, this is a wine to stock up on.",Early Release,87,12.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Brander

France,"Remember those vaguely anise-like white gumdrops? That describes the aromas and flavors found in the 2006 Les Sinards, albeit without the sugar.

Argentina,"Blackberry and plum aromas have just enough leather and horsehide accents to give this wine character.

Lively and with all the basics in the right places.",,87,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Alberti 154

Spain,"Quite an oaky wine, with aromas of BBQ, hickory, roasted plum and spice. The body is full but scratchy, with additional oak manifesting itself in the form of baked, rooty, vanilla flavors that override the wine's simple but quiet fruit content.

US,"With its Ace-Jack of spades on the label, this dark and moody Pinot Noir seems to say “call my bluff, I dare you!” But it's not a bluff—the flavors are real and substantial, with black fruits, red licorice, cola and smoke threading their way into a tannic, meaty finish.",BlackJack,91,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,David Hill

Really good Chardonnay.",Bell Mountain Vineyard,92,20.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Medlock Ames

Portugal,"This is a hugely powerful and dense wine. It is packed with dense tannins at this stage although with the promise of rich, opulent fruit behind the tannins it will blossom in a serious, complex wine with both great fruit and structure. Drink this serious wine from 2018.",Grande Reserva,93,110.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo

US,"Like the winery's “Fuller” Pinot Noir, this special, limited-edition offering honors some Oregon wine industry stalwarts, the owners of Elton Vineyards. It clearly reflects the flavors of the Eola-Amity Hills AVA—no tricks or attempts to hide the natural earthy, herbal character. Herb and sassafras, pine needle and sour cherry, spice and even a hint of pickle barrel (American oak?) mingle pleasantly, and the alcohol remains at a comfortable 13.3%.",O'Brien,90,100.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley Vineyards
Australia,"This wine's back label talks a big game: “If you can find a bigger wine, buy it!” At 16.5% alcohol, it's a big wine that wears its size well (but you don't have to go far to find a bigger wine—Warrabilla's Paola's bottling is a percent higher in alcohol). Medium-sized and flavorful, with dense purple fruit and soft tannins, this wine is moderate, not superrich, and best that way.",Reserve,88,40.0,Victoria,Rutherglen,,Durif,Warrabilla

Austria,"Biiri is the old name for vineyards in Deutschkreuz, the home of the Igler winery. This is a smooth, mint-perfumed wine, shot through with wood, but also bringing some solid red fruits to the fore. It is weighty, but not overpowering. For the wood to fully integrate, give it another year.",Biiri Reserve,92,34.0,Mittelburgenland,,,Blaufränkisch,Hans Igler

Italy,"The Rizzi family of Barbaresco does amazing work with its specific vineyard crus. One of its best sites is the Fondetta vineyard, although this vintage seems more nervous and raw than in past years. Clover, spice and green capers are some of the more interesting aromatic characteristics of this wine. You'll also get bright fruit and lemon zest on the close.",Nervo Fondetta,89,49.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Rizzi

The blend continues as before—54% Merlot, 33% Cab Franc, 7% Petit Verdot, and 6% Malbec, all estate-grown. The wine opens with barrel scents and flavors of tea, tobacco and wood smoke. The cherry-flavored fruit saturates the tobacco notes, gaining mass and turning into cherry cobbler as it does.",Uriah Red Wine,93,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Spring Valley Vineyard

New Zealand,"New Zealand's best known winery does a consistently good job with the Burgundian varieties, not just Sauvignon Blanc.

US,"Thurston Wolfe pioneered Zinfandel in Washington. This is the seventh vintage from the Zephyr Ridge vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills, vinified to California-style alcohol levels of 15.5%.

Germany,"The biggest difference between Huber's R bottlings and this Alte Reben (old vine) Pinot Noir is the crispness of this wine's acids.

Portugal,A palate of exotic perfumes with layers of dark chocolate and dense tannins certainly give this wine great power.

Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, it's great to drink now and over the next four years.",Maestro Collection Ranch No. 2,92,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaulieu Vineyard
Spain,"Apparently the allure of Rioja proved too great for the Torres family, because now they have a wine from Spain's signature region. Ibéricos is dark and fruity, with exotic perfume notes and also some soupy qualities. The flavors of strawberry and raspberry have a thick creamy accent, while vanilla and dill are prominent on the finish. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Ibéricos,87,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Soto de Torres
Argentina,"Packed and concentrated, with blueberry, blackberry, bramble and pastry aromas. Initially, it's jumbled and out of joint, with jumpy acids and heavy flavors of blackberry, grilled meat and herbs, while on the finish, the fruit fades quickly, leaving weight, resin and vanilla.",Bramare Rebon Vineyard,89,55.0,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,Malbec,Viña Cobos

It has the elegant structure, fine acidity and forward raspberry, strawberry, lime, vanilla and smoke flavors of the dry bruts, with a sugary finish, for those who like their bubblies on the sweet side.",Cuvée M,86,15.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa
US,"It's hard to imagine a more voluptuous wine, but it's also powerful and complex, offering up endlessly changing palate impressions. The primary flavor is ripe, juicy blackberries, while fine oak does its thing. The tannins are wonderfully soft and refined. With no Cabernet Sauvignon, and just a little Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, this wine restores my belief in Merlot as the seductive, sensual alternative to Cab.",,95,48.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Etude

Chile,"This is charred and burnt smelling, with a rubbery, hickory aroma that covers up the wine's cherry and berry scents. The palate bears flavors of raspberry, pie cherry and green herb, finishing quick as a flash, with tannic residue.",Angostura Gran Reserva,82,22.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Merlot,Casa Silva
US,"The scent of apple blossoms perfume this round, richly structured wine, accentuating flavors of apple and pear on the palate. Touches of vanilla and cream add weight and mouthfeel, but the wine finishes crisp with lemony acidity and saline minerality.",,87,18.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Jamesport
Australia,"Because of the extreme heat of 2008, this wine does show a touch of warmth on the finish and should probably be consumed young, but there's no crime in that. It's a luscious blend of lime custard and roasted cashew that's rich without being heavy, and finishes long and clean.",M3,91,35.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,Chardonnay,Shaw and Smith
US,"This wine has a perceptible tawny tone despite its youth, and the scents also seem to suggest that the wine is slightly oxidized. Whiffs of sherry and apple cider lead into a soft, flat, rather dull palate of nondescript fruit.",,83,14.0,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,Pinot Gris,Hinman

Chile,"The floral, candied aromas seem odd for Chile. On the palate this feels powerful and wide, with flavors of floral red berry, kirsch and spiced jam. It feels juicy and high in acidity; the finish lacks some texture.",Edición Limitada de Familia,85,27.0,Loncomilla Valley,,,Red Blend,Cremaschi Furlotti
US,"Peju's regular Cab Franc, released a year ago, was immediately drinkable. This reserve, with a tiny case production, is denser and more tannic, but shows the same charm. It's a fat, fleshy wine, with luscious black cherry tart, cola and caramelized oak flavors.

US,"The 2004, like so many Walla Walla wines, was sourced from a different mix of vineyards. In this case the grapes came from Cold Creek, Canoe Ridge, DuBrul and Artz – a very fine group indeed. There's no slip in quality here, just a bit of added richness and darker fruits than in the previous vintage. Blackberry purée laced with coffee liqueur dominates this open, accessible, and thoroughly enjoyable wine. Nicely balanced and showing its youthful freshness in a clean and softly seductive style.",,89,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Seven Hills
US,"This Chardonnay is creamy and scented with vanilla, ripe apple and pineapple. The fruit has a slightly overripe quality, a suggestion of funk on the finish, and the vanilla seems artificial. It says unoaked, but that's a lot of vanilla nonetheless.",Unoaked Estate,84,12.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,David Hill
Chile,"This is a funky, pushy type of wine, with prickly aromas of green herb and berry. For a 2007, it is big and a bit rough, with an herbal, green-leaning berry flavor distinctive of this producer and its Los Lingues Vineyard. It finishes with additional herbal kick and heat.",Microterroir de Los Lingues,87,48.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Casa Silva
Argentina,"Nice and pure, with controlled berry aromas, a dash of pepper and integrated background oak.

Italy,"Barolo Vigna San Giacomo is a meaty, masculine expression of Nebbiolo with dense, dark fruit, cherry, plum and prune with accents of bresaola, smoked beef and spice. The tannins are drying and firm and this style of wine could pair with turkey roast with raisin, apple and sage stuffing.",Vigna San Giacomo,91,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Stroppiana
Argentina,"Not a hair is out of place on this pure and potent Malbec. The bouquet is crusty and rich, with berry and bitter chocolate aromas.

Alberto,91,38.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia

Spain,"Smooth berries and plenty of dark licorice carry the seductive bouquet. And seeing that this is Remelluri's signature high-priced red, you should expect the fine berry, plum and chocolate flavors that rest comfortably on the palate. But like many '02s, the wine has a hard mouthfeel and pronounced acidity, so it doesn't quite trigger all the pleasure points that it might in a better vintage.",Colección Jaime Rodríguez,89,104.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,"Granja Ntra, Sra. de Remelluri"

US,"This floral wine opens as if in a damp but not wet forest, surrounded by ripe, red cherry trees. Likable from the start, it's grippy on the palate, expressively juicy, seductive and refined.

Australia,"Nicely complex on the nose, delivering scents of ripe plums, roasted meat, wood smoke and peppery herbs.

Too bad there are only 70 cases of this distinctive, flavorful and fairly priced Shiraz for the U.S.",,89,23.0,South Australia,Fleurieu Peninsula,,Shiraz,Cascabel
US,"This is a Bordeaux blend; the winery's entry-level Cabernet. What that means, say the winemakers, is that it's made to be a little softer, more fruit forward—a wine for immediate pleasure. Most is estate (Walla Walla) fruit, despite the Columbia Valley designation. It's soft and fruity, with strawberry and juicy fruit/tropical flavors. Not exactly plump, but broad and generous, with a little spicy kick to the finish.",,87,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dusted Valley
Spain,"Dry and fiery, with leaf and herb aromas going head to head with light raspberry. The palate has some depth and sweetness to it, and at the core it's showing cherry, plum and spice flavors.

US,"Aromatic, rich and dry, this wine was fermented in used Chardonnay barrels and given extended lees contact.

A wine of individuality and earthiness, but also atypical.",Stefani Vineyard,88,20.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gallo of Sonoma
US,"Sometimes a reserve designation on a Chardonnay simply translates to excessive use of new oak; here it brings a rich abundance of fruit, along with a density and texture rarely found in domestic Chardonnays. This is a fruit salad of a wine, to be sure, running through a farmer's market's worth of peaches, apples, pears, apricots, bananas and more. But it also brings the butter, the butterscotch and the barrel toast, layered in and wrapped around the fruits so it has the richness of a banana split, and some of the creaminess as well.",Reserve,91,26.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Lemelson

Well, the fact that it's varietal Petit Verdot from the Duero River Valley, which is not common; that and the fact that it's a mind-boggling $200.

Argentina,"Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core.

US,"This is an aromatic, smoky, herbal and ultimately captivating Syrah. Dense, smoky, tarry and herbal, it is a serious effort from a winery that specializes in the grape.

US,"If you choose one wine to stick in the cellar from the '03 vintage, make it this one. It's so dry, balanced and complex, yet so tannicly tough now, that it demands a good 6 years, at a minimum. The heart of blackberries and red currants is opulently rich, with overtones of cedar, pencil lead, red licorice and sweet dried herbs. Brings to mind a classic Rutherford Cab.

US,"Pinotphiles will appreciate that this was 100% destemmed for fermentation. The fruit is the star, suggesting freshly crushed blackberries, cherries, black raspberries and cola, spiced up with cinnamon, anise and nutmeg. An elegant sipper that gets better as it warms. Try decanting for a couple hours before serving.",,89,33.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Verve
US,"The vineyard is severely vintage-dependent, with some years much better than others, but the superbly generous 2007 harvest has resulted in this delicious mountain wine. It's perfectly ripe, offering an array of blackberries, cherries and currants wrapped into beautifully mature tannins and grounded with a firm minerality.

Drink now and over the next 10 years, at least.",55% Slope,94,45.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hidden Ridge
Argentina,"A little stinky and oily, which is often the downfall of the variety. The palate has a viscous grab to it and the flavors are rather generic and rudimentary, i.e. simple apple and melon with a mild chemical burn. Seems only semifresh at a young age.",,84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Torrontés,Bodega Goulart
US,"A beautiful, lush Chardonnay, made in the ripe California style. Rich and creamy, marked with brisk acidity, it shows wonderful flavors of pineapples, roasted marshmallows, buttered toast and vanilla, with a tart, spicy scour of lime. Brilliant and complex. The vineyards were a combination of Sierra Madre and Bien Nacido.",,94,23.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Rusack
US,"I love this wine for its balance and dryness. The texture is velvety-silky and gently tannic, while the flavors are complex, suggesting red cherries with the astringent skins, mashed black raspberries, tangerines, cola, root beer, dark unsweetened chocolate, a touch of cassis liqueur, and something earthy, like Portobello mushrooms. This is really a gorgeous Pinot Noir that will develop over the next five years or so.",Doña Margarita Vineyard,96,45.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate

Inoffensive and a touch weak.",Tributo Single Vineyard,84,20.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Pinot Noir,Caliterra
US,"This is so smooth, rich and mellow, you hardly notice how intense the tannins are. But they are hard, and lock down the flavors of black currant and black licorice, plus the complex notes of minerals, roasted game and dark spices. Drink this Malbec-based blend now after decanting and over the next six years.",Dragon's Tooth,93,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Trefethen
France,"Spicy musky notes hover above scents of canned peaches. On the palate, these rich peach notes are framed by pleasantly bitter notes of pith and peach skin.

Chile,"One of the best values in Chilean wine is Quatro, a lusty blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Carmenère and Syrah.

US,"The winery produces two outstanding Pinots from estate vineyards planted in 1972. This is big and chewy (as the potent alcohol might suggest) and aging in 50% new French oak puts flavors of toasted coconut and caramel around smooth supple cherry fruit.

US,". Though it is five years old and just being released, this thick, tannic and rich Bordeaux blend still requires decanting, cellaring, and/or extensive breathing time. A full day after first being tasted, it came together for me; the initial, aggressively herbal character is equally matched to ripe black cherry fruit and massive tannins. The nose suggests sweet cherry, but the palate leans more to the herbal side, with flavors of earth, stem and leaf, and there is a green tea residual flavor that infuses the finish.

US,"Ladera's regular Napa Cab is really good. This one's nearly twice the price. What do you get? The wine is higher in alcohol, and tastes woodier, too, with a sugared blackberry tea sweetness.

US,"There's a slightly meaty edge to this wine that may put some people off, but in our view it's simply another layer of complexity, gently spread on top of smoke, cedar, dark chocolate and maple syrup. Full and creamy, with a long, toasty finish that's prolonged by juicy acids.",Private Reserve,88,28.0,California,Redwood Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Merlot,Lolonis

Spain,"Fresh, pure and minerally, with lime and peach aromas. This is a fine Viura that is lively, balanced and flavorful.

US,"In the context of the rest of the outstanding 2009 Pinots from Soléna, this seems the lightest. Soft, spicy fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, accented with rose water, set up an elegant, thinnish palate, with residual tannic flavors of green tea.

US,"Brings to mind the 2001 bottling, which originally was also pale in color, tightly wound and firm in acidity. Like it, this '07 is not showing well now.

US,"This is 100% Petite Sirah, jet black, tannic and layered with hints of forest floor, fungus, dried leaf and wild berry. From the Zephyr Ridge vineyard, it's quite astringent, clearly varietal in character, and a fine example of what can be done with this grape in Washington State.",,88,22.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Petite Sirah,Thurston Wolfe
US,"Fresh whiffs of strawberry and blossom go hand-in-hand with more evolved complexities of mushroom and yeast in this invigorating rosé sparkling.

Italy,"Made from organically farmed grapes, this hearty blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo opens with earthy aromas of violets, iris, mature black fruit and leather.

US,"Dramatically structured, this is a firm, full-bodied young Cab that needs time. Shows slightly astringent tannins at the moment, with Bordeaux-like acidity and a dry, spicy finish.

Mainly Cab Sauv, with some Cab Franc and Merlot.",Tesserae,93,65.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Garden Creek
Italy,"An exceptional example of an underappreciated appellation, this Gattinara offers up a gorgeous nose of animal, leather and spice accented by high floral tones. The palate has mature tannins and a complex tangle of flavors ranging from charcoal-grilled meat to earth and mushrooms. A nice kick of acidity on the finish means it can stand up to even the heaviest duck dishes.",Riserva,91,55.0,Piedmont,Gattinara,,Nebbiolo,Dessilani

Italy,"Le Coste Mosconi delivers a very attractive ensemble of ripe fruit aromas with oak-driven shadings of vanilla, cinnamon and clove.

Italy,"Thanks to the super tight and astringent tannins that are present in the Sagrantino grape, you'll want to pair this Umbrian red with succulent steak or a thick slab of aged pecorino.

US,"This tastes riper and hotter than the winery's other Pinots I tasted, almost to the point of raisins and stewed prunes. The vintage was very difficult, with stupendous heat waves that challenged both growers and vintners. The wine does its best, but can't quite overcome the ill effects of the heat.",Melville,86,64.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Brewer-Clifton

US,Quite big and decadent smelling as notes of caramel-drizzled apple pie with vanilla ice cream on top emanate from the glass. The mouth is full and milky with solid acidity supporting the rich flavors of toasted brioche and smoky apple.

Argentina,"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.",Atemporal,89,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Alta Vista

US,"This is definitely showing the tight, tart, almost steely side of Syrah. It focuses on minerality, a rarely seen rocky aspect to the grape, without the earthy funk or jammy fruit of Walla Walla Syrahs. Sleek and elegant and very well-crafted.",DuBrul Vineyard,91,65.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Côte Bonneville

Bold and meaty but not endowed with much finesse or variety.",Tempranillo - Cabernet Sauvignon - Shiraz,86,12.0,Central Spain,Madrid,,Red Blend,Alta Marca
US,"A chewy, high-acid take on Merlot, with a strong herbal note to the tannins. It might almost pass for Carmenère. The fruit flavors are subdued but ripe enough, and the alcohol touches 14.7%. This is the sort of muscular Merlot that can take the place of Cabernet alongside a grilled steak.",Seven Hills Vineyard,88,28.0,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Oregon Other,Merlot,Tempus Cellars

Italy,"Pleasing aromas of stone fruit, grapefruit and white mineral make a very nice first impression: This Soave Classico would pair perfectly with exotic dishes borrowing from Chinese or Thai culinary tradition. It's thin and informal in the mouth, but the natural acidity keeps your palate refreshed.",Terre di Monteforte,85,,Veneto,Soave Classico,,Garganega,Cantina di Monteforte
US,"With its bouquet of black plum, leather and dried herb notes, this lean Zin has good berry fruit. However, its attributes are balanced by a note of volatile acidity on the nose, and it shows some definite heat in the mouth. The narrow, rather angular structure of the wine seems to constrain the blackberry and spice flavors here. Closes with full, fairly even tannins.",Frei Vineyard,84,19.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gallo of Sonoma
Argentina,"Ripe and smooth, with hints of molasses, toast, and vanilla as well as mulberry and blackberry. The wine runs sweet but masculine, with chocolate as the prime secondary flavor.

US,"Here's a Pinot Blanc that's not a Chardonnay lookalike, with its melange of wildflower and tropical fruit aromas. There's something almost Rhône-like in the opulence of its flavors, with chocolate, honey, brown-crushed spice and nectarines in a crisp wine with a long finish. It misses a few points because of a certain lack of complexity, but flavor freaks won't be disappointed by this jolting wine.",,88,15.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Valley of the Moon

US,"This fragrant rose opens with very pleasant aromas of strawberries, candied lemon peel, vanilla and smoke. The flavors are full, with plenty of earth and yeasty notes around the berry core.

US,"A mirror image of the winery's 2005 Merlot, this reverses the proportions, with Cabernet making up 90% of the blend.

US,"Lovely and aromatic, it's made in large enough quantities to be easily found. Lemon curd and orange blossom pop out first, followed by a soft, minerally midpalate and an intense finish of citrus. A good white to stock up on for a myriad of occasions.",,87,16.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Benziger
US,"The winemaker aged this wine for 20 months in 100% new French oak, resulting in an oak-dominated product that bears notes of buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel. Green apple and pear flavors can be found, but they're basically swamped.",,84,45.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Super Sonoman

Chile,"Interesting and not that far off the mark. Normally Chardonnay and Viognier make for clumsy partners, but not so in this case.

Spain,"Dark as night, with forceful aromas of root beer, menthol, warm earth and baked fruits. Maybe it's a bit soft and widespread given the heat of 2003, but if flesh and fruit turn you on and the lack of complexity isn't too disconcerting, it's a fine modern Syrah.

Australia,"This is a frankly sweet, dessert style of still Moscato. It's modest in alcohol, offering up notes of oranges, melons and honey that are reasonably balanced on the finish. The price makes it a bargain.",Bin 90,85,7.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Moscato,Lindemans
US,"A very strong take on this increasingly reliable Rhône grape, this wine from New Orleans-raised vintner Iris Rideau shows dried blackberry, leather, chopped herbs and violets on the lovely nose.

Chile,"Muscled up and dark, with robust blackberry, tar, spice and mocha aromas. The palate is big and dense but raring to run, with smashing black cherry, berry and black plum lushness.

Italy,"Mature berry, dark cooking spice and blue flower are some of the aromas that emerge on this firm red.

US,"This single-vineyard blend is drinking very well. There is an unusual minty spice underlying the cassis and cherry fruit, and it provides a nice line for the flavors as they weave across the palate.

US,"Ripe and juicy in mango, pineapple and pear flavors, with a generous dollop of toasty oak and a vanilla cream texture. Finishes a bit sharp in acidity, but refreshing and tasty.",Kali Hart,85,13.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Talbott
France,"A wonderful mélange of honey, orange, apricot and spice; there's a lot of complexity to this wine, all carried by a plump, mouthcoating texture and ample freshness. Delicious now, so why hold it any longer?",La Chambée,90,42.0,Rhône Valley,Condrieu,,Viognier,Les Vins de Vienne
France,"Rather rich and intense for a Saint-Péray, marrying honeyed orange flavors with dry, minerally notes. Nice perfume, nice mouthfeel, nice flavors—the complete package. Drink now.",Les Bialères,90,20.0,Rhône Valley,Saint-Péray,,Rhône-style White Blend,Les Vins de Vienne
France,"Made from old vines, this ripe and concentrated wine is smooth and creamy. Good acidity balances the rich fruits, giving flavors of apples, pears and apricots cut by a line of citrus. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017.",Les Grands Vignes,88,30.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine Chenevières
Slovenia,"This fascinating blend of biodynamically farmed Malvasia, Ribolla and Welschriesling balances savory smoke and toasted wood notes with sweet elements of apple, lemon and cream. Fermented with indigenous yeast, it's a richly textured wine with deep complexity.",Burja Bela,88,,Vipavska Dolina,,,White Blend,Burja
US,"Made in the Heirloom style, which is huge, extracted and potent. The '07 shows the preternatural ripeness of the vintage, offering massive cherry and black raspberry fruit, along with sizable tannins. The winemaker has framed this power with considerable oak. The result admittedly is seismic, but it is another success for Heirloom, and is likely to age for at least a dozen years.",Heirloom,94,90.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Etude
France,"89–91. Barrel sample. This is a concentrated wine that's very full in the mouth and shows its structure right up front. It has acidity and some juiciness, but the fruit is still very suppressed by the dryness.",Barrel Sample,90,,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Camensac
US,"Tastes jammy all the way through, with raspberry and cherry flavors that start and end sweet and sugary. The problem isn't the ripeness, it's the balance and control throughout the palate experience.

Good now with grilled shrimp.",Ingrid's Vineyard,90,45.0,California,Carmel Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Bernardus
Italy,"Tenuta di Sesta is run by a perfect father-mother-daughter-son team and is located in one of the least-traveled corners of Montalcino. The 2007 Brunello delivers sweet oak tones that drive the initial bouquet and are soon followed by bright cherry, vanilla bean, sweet mocha and rum cake. Pretty balsam notes at the back will undoubtedly increase and evolve with age. Cellar this wine 10 years.",,94,90.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Tenuta di Sesta

Finishes like a melon ball, but at least the mouthfeel is good and not flabby.",,85,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Rutini
Argentina,"Dry berry fruit and spice make for a solid but very common and regular type of nose. The palate is based on a lively bead of acids that lift and amplify the flavors of plum and cherry. A little hot but solid on the finish, thus it leaves a tangy final impression.",Medalla,87,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trapiche
Italy,"You'll love this traditional expression of Barbaresco and its excellent balancing act between the elegance of its natural fruit aromas and the spicy oak-related tones that embellish it.

US,"Yes, it's sparkling Syrah, made famous by the Aussies. As dark as a red wine, it's so deliciously aromatic in cherry pie, chocolate fudge and caramel scents, it makes your mouth water.

A curiosity, but a good one.",Black Bubbles Syrah,90,16.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Syrah,Steele
US,"An impressive young Bordeaux blend, mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, that shows impeccably ripe, clean fruit but also the hard tannins of its famous mountain.

Argentina,"Nice black cherry, cassis and earthy rubber aromas form a familiar, friendly type of Malbec nose, while the palate is juicy and lifted by acidity.

France,"From a vineyard planted with almost 7,000 vines per acre, and with low yields (2 bunches) per vine, you would expect concentration.

Now–2016, at least.",Brosseau Vineyard,93,54.0,California,Chalone,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
Italy,"Another solid, rustic red from Umbria, with dark berry, cumin earth aromas.  The four grapes in the blend- Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Cannaiolo, and Ciliegiolo -are vinified separately, then blended prior to cask aging.

Drink through 2019.",Viña Real Reserva,90,32.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,CVNE

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Carr
Argentina,"Baked apple and buttercup aromas get it going in a good way, but the palate doesn't really keep the momentum.

Uruguay,"Maybe this wine weighs in a bit stewy and heavy, but along the way it has some virtues, namely an attractive rum-raisin quality to the bouquet and intense black-fruit flavors. It's a chunky wine that stumbles along the palate, but you have to admire it's richness and stuffing. The blend is Tannat, Cabernet and Merlot.",TCM,85,19.0,Canelones,,,Red Blend,Toscanini

Spain,"A more traditional type of crianza with vanilla, spice, dry berry fruit and a quiet, subtle approach.

Italy,"The Brunate cru, with denser soils, is known for meatier, more structured wines.

With 13% Carmenère.",Reserva,88,17.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Syrah,Koyle
Chile,"A little bit wild and sauvage, as Merlot from Chile is known to be. Flavors of herbal berry fruit and plum work the core, while the finish is woody and resiny, but also a little zingy and acidic. Not so much tart but definitely a little more snappy and “red” than the norm.",Gran Reserva,86,15.0,Maule Valley,,,Merlot,TerraNoble
Italy,"This modern Brunello is intensely redolent of roasted nuts, vanilla and espresso bean and although these oak-driven notes are very pretty, there's not much fresh fruit in the background. The wine boasts thick extraction and density but probably won't age more than three or four more years.",,88,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Sesta di Sopra
US,"Another interesting Chard from this Santa Lucia Highlands estate; why the Wagners don't put that appellation on the label is a mystery. The wine seems even higher in acidity than usual, with greater ageworthiness, and experience shows this is one for the cellar. The tropical fruit flavors are well oaked, and finish absolutely dry. Best after 2008.",,90,42.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Mer Soleil

Italy,This wine shows a touch of age or flatness and its ruby color also shows some mild browning. The wine will hold a few more years but the fruit tones present now won't last forever. You'll get aromas of wild berries and red apple.,Colarej,88,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Cantine Gemma
France,"A perfumed note of citrus peel and soft pine create a bracing nose that nonetheless suggests ripeness. The body is lithe and light, with a backdrop of stone and subtle nuttiness. With a little more air, the characteristic notes of mature Riesling appear: some lifted chamomile and candied orange peel, but only in their early stages. This is a wine of immense depth and deceptive lightness that has years of life ahead. Drink through 2030.",Cuvée Frédéric Emile,95,60.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Trimbach
Argentina,"Very few Argentine wines feature quality Tempranillo blended with Malbec, but that's what B Crux does and it's a major reason why I like it so much.

Drink it over the next few years.",Plan de Dieu,87,19.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône Villages,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Château du Trignon

US,"Made in a very ripe style, this Cab-based Bordeaux blend is fat and rich in cherries, blackberries, chocolate, cola and cedar flavors.

US,"Forward and—at least for the moment—quite oaky, this is tasty, although it does not expand into more complicated flavors. The 70% new French oak barrels seem to over-ride the fruit, giving it a somewhat monolithic impression. Drink up while it retains its youthful freshness.",Pepper Bridge Vineyard,87,29.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Two Vintners
Italy,"Here's a sophisticated wine from Franciacorta near Brescia in Northern Italy.

US,"A great followup to the '08, which was one of the best Gewürztraminers of the vintage.

Drink now through 2018.",,87,21.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Lemberger,Fox Run
US,"This racy Cabernet is full of tart red fruits; its flavors are forward and lightly spicy. The wine seems to have been acidified, perhaps to provide some lift.

US,"Very rich and complex. Shows the immaturity of a young wine, with primary fruit flavors of cherries, black raspberries, red currants, red licorice, teriaki beef and cinnamon, accented with crisp acidity.

The finish confuses rather than blends.",,85,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Le Chateau

Imported by American Estates Wines, Inc.",Roaring Meg,86,20.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Mt. Difficulty
US,"The grapes are from Oak Knoll, a southerly, cooler district, and while the wine is very ripe and oaky, it has bright acidity.

US,"Sweet and jammy in youth, with robust flavors of raspberry and cherry jam. The sweetness is balanced by crisp acidity and firm tannins, as well as a minerality that must come from the terroir.

Italy,"Mature aromas of raspberry jam emerge at first and are followed by darker tones of prunes and plums.

You'll love the elegant packaging too.",,88,,Central Italy,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,,Montepulciano,Binomio
US,"From Klipsun and Hedges fruit, this muscular, aromatic Merlot begins with pretty berry scents, then develops flavors of currant and cherry.

France,"This Krug vintage is showing some maturity, especially from its toast aroma. But certainly not too much maturity, because on the palate the fruit remains young at heart, a crisp burst of freshness coming through the more mature acidity.

Australia,"Being inland and dry-farmed, Jasper Hill wines tend to show considerable vintage variation.

US,"I'm not sure Howell Mountain is the best place for Merlot, because the dry, rugged terrain imparts strong tannins that seem weird in this supposedly gentle red variety. This 100% Merlot has big cherry, blackberry, cocoa and sweet new oak flavors wrapped in a firmly astringent, sandpapery texture. Decanting will help. So will a rich, fatty steak.",,88,75.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Merlot,Luna
US,"The '06 had a hard act to follow after the classic 2005. It's not as great a Pinot Noir, showing a tannic brittleness and heaviness despite a rich undertow of red currants, mocha and spices. As good as it is, it lacks a refined elegance, and its hope lies in the cellar.",Rosemary's Vineyard,88,70.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Talley

Australia,"This is a Barossa wine, so there's a sense of warmth and sweetly ripe fruit, yet it's also Cabernet, so that's coupled with a sense of restraint and traditional cassis and cigar box notes.

US,"Winemaker Ryan Deovlet isn't afraid of prominent oak, so this comes on with a luscious butterscotch nose, and it immediately smells like it will be a silky wine. It is, with accents of vanilla and a touch of bitterness, but the overriding flavor is smokiness, reminiscent of the rustic Mexican liquor, Mezcal. This could easily handle pork carnitas.",Ineseño,90,24.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Rhône-style White Blend,Refugio Ranch

US,"This has to be the only blend of Pinot Noir, Syrah, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay produced in California, and maybe in the world. Dry and tasty as it is, it's certainly an eccentric wine.

US,"Co-fermented with Marsanne, this shows more forward fruit than Reynvaan's In The Rocks Syrah. It's dominated by fruit, spice and pepper, along with a hint of granite. The herbal side of the grape is here a bit constrained, and the wine has the structure—especially the minerality—to age for a considerable time.

It's dotted with fine-grained, coffee-streaked tannins, and finishes with highlights of butterscotch and malted milk candies. As with all the 2005 Quilceda's, this is still young and tight.

Argentina,"In a shrinking domain (wines for under $10), this junior-league Malbec shows sweet, jammy aromas and legitimate berry flavors. And that alone puts it ahead of the game.

US,"This is a frankly delicious young Cabernet, hailing from a small vineyard to showcase its qualities.

Absolutely dry, it shows a crisp mineralityF to the pear, pineapple, toasted meringue and sweet, charry oak flavors, and the finish is amazingly deep and long. This is really an impressive Chardonnay.",,92,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem

US,"An unusual combination of flavors that are searingly tart and yet seem to have a sugary core, this is scented with honeysuckle and orange blossom, and opens out quickly into a fruitbowl of ripe, tangy flavors.

US,"This initially tastes like young fruit, herbal, with a lot of stem and flower flavors, but with some heat at 16% alcohol.

US,"A nicely done microscopic-production Syrah out of Livermore Valley's Madden Ranch, the source for many a Syrah, not always so deliciously rendered.

US,"This is a splendid rendition of Chateau Ste. Michelle's mainstay Cabernet, rich and round, with a sophisticated mix of grapes, including Malbec, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah. Dark fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis create a lush center, and the wine is more evolved and smoother, with less obvious oak and barrel flavor, than the pricier Cabs from Ste. Michelle.",,90,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Ste. Michelle

Chile,"Like the Chilean Merlot of olden days, this one is fairly mulchy and astringent. And it's also a bit old tasting, with some core berry fruit but mostly earthy flavors and forced spice. Some red fruit on the finish helps it, but still there isn't much essence to this wine.",Viejo Feo,83,11.0,Maule Valley,,,Merlot,Viña Tinajas
Chile,"Three years running, this wine has been getting better. It shows textbook Elqui aromas of jalapeno peppers and gooseberry, while the flavors are a little tropical due to pineapple notes.

US,"Some will criticize this Chardonnay for being too oaky and sweet, but it sure is delicious.

Australia,"Aromas are dark but delicate, and quite nice: clay, ink, charcoal. This is clearly a wine with promise, judging by its texture and tannins, yet this bottling just isn't singing for me.

US,"A dramatic young wine, fleshy and dazzling now for its lush fruit and oak, although the tannins have a crunchy hardness. But that merely ensures ageability. It's beautiful the way the acid-tannin structure plays against the cherry, cassis and olive fruit, creating an architectural tension. If you open this wine now, decant for a few hours.

Italy,"This Riserva is measured in terms of its aromatic intensity and although it does deliver cherry, spice and warm notes of leather and almond, it does so in a very understated manner.

France,"From vines close to the Sachets Premier Cru vineyard, this wine is powerful, structured and dense, despite the relatively low alcohol that gives it a lift of red fruits, acidity and perfume.

This wine is better than the Scrubby Rise Shiraz, but is only available in Florida and Texas (the latter locale is understandable, as this wine is probably a heavenly marriage wtih barbecue!).

Argentina,"Given the difficulties of 2008, this is a commendable, drinkable wine. The nose is full and dark, with ripe berry aromas.

US,"The aroma is all caramelized wood and the dominant flavor is buttered toast and caramel. Wood tannins also come into play, adding to the grape tannins to make for a tough mouthfeel.

Chile,"Yellow tinted, which announces that this wine was barrel aged. And that barrel character is huge on the nose, which smells of raw oak, vanilla and dried cheese.

A quality wine but definitely not for everyone.",Alfa Centauri,86,32.0,Leyda Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,O. Fournier
US,"This is a big wine, and not really showing its best now. It's raw-boned. The oak is all smoky and spicy and dominant; the fruit is massive in pears, crunchy apples and pineapples; the acidity on the finish is tart.

US,"This is a big, fleshy wine, with evident tannins and acidity that give it bite and structure. The flavors are ripe and pure, suggesting red and black cherry pie filling, with lots of dusty spice and a hint of sweet oak. It will be very nice now and over the next 4–5 years.

Italy,"This smooth, balanced offering shows plenty of cherry, leather and cedar flavors.

US,"Côte Bonneville releases this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend quite late, so it's well into the maturing process. Pretty aromas of smoke, tea and mint accompany secondary fruit flavors.

Argentina,"Dark yet a touch murky on the bouquet, with weight and black-fruit aromas. The palate is plump but healthy, with peppery flavors accenting core blackberry and chocolate. Chunky and proper, if a tad bit bitter on the finish. Gets better as it airs out.",Altosur,87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Merlot,Finca Sophenia
Australia,"The fruit aromas are pretty: plums and black cherries. Add fine oak aromas of smoke, cocoa, vanilla, toast and menthol, and this has all the ingredients to please.

France,"This 100% Chenin Blanc is a beautiful exaple of what the variety can express: soft florals loaded with garrigue notes alongside tropical fruit aromas of mango, guava and pineapple. It's vibrant in the mouth, with moderate acidity and a lifting backbone of lemon verbena.

US,"One of the biggest, boldest, ripest Chardonnays in California, marked as usual by intense flavors, which the winemaker has boosted with oak. Just explodes in pineapple and apricot jam, tangerine custard and buttered toast, brightened by zesty acidity. The wine will age, gradually losing fruit and picking up roasted nut notes.",Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Estate Grown,92,40.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Talbott

Spain,"Husky on the nose but mostly it comes across as wild, with jumpy, loud pear, melon and apple aromas.

France,"A second label of the famous second growth, Chateau Gruaud Larose, this wine offers charming scents of cherries, cedar and herb, but clamps down on the palate with dusty, slightly drying tannins that don't appear to have the depth of fruit to support them for long-term aging.

US,"Though this wine offers the vibrant cherry fruit and pepper of a good New York Cab Franc, it's a bit one-dimensional.

US,"Syrah dominates, happily, dialing in lovely peppery spice that enlivens the tangy red fruit.

US,"The vineyard is 1,800 feet up the mountain and the wine was made by Randy Dunn's (Dunn Vineyards) son, Mike. Howell Mountain produces some of California's densest, most ageworthy red wines, and this big, dry, tannic Pet is a sure cellar candidate.

Australia,"Crisp, racy and minty; I liked this wine more than I generally like HP's very earthy Scotsdale bottlings.

US,"Crisp acidity and firm tannins give a framework to this massively fruity, rather extracted blend of all five Bordeaux varieties.

Fine now with a grilled steak, and for the next several years.",Red Wine,88,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Hendry

Spain,"Bee's wax, roast squash and vanilla are the dominant aromas, and all indicate a fading wine that was borderline overripe to begin with.

France,"From a parcel within the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, this is beautifully balanced, but a wine with considerable potential.

Australia,"There are no complaints with this Chardonnay. Apple, pineapple, butter and toasted oak load the flavor package. The perfect balance and velvety mouthfeel provide a solid background.

US,"This is very soft upon entry, with remnants of penetrating spicy and herbal flavors that might have punched up the intensity if they hadn't been somehow smoothed over. It's difficult to assess, because many of the right pieces are all here, but somehow they have not jelled.

Argentina,"Bodega Chacra is Piero Incisa's personal project in Rio Negro, Argentina. It is only Pinot Noir, made by esteemed winemaker Hans Vinding Diers. This wine from vines planted in 1932 is linear and intense to the core. It's an ageworthy specimen with fine acidity and a tight structure.

Argentina,"Jammy strawberry aromas are alluring but light, which suggests more of an Old World style compared to most of the beefy, brawny Malbecs out there today.

Italy,"The 17% alcohol is a bit frightening but this wine does a reasonably good job of absorbing the heat by contrasting it with strawberry preserves, moist earth, raspberry roll-up and nutty aromas (no wood is used). It does, however, boast enormous intensity in the mouth, with sweet fruit flavors. It's an “intellectual-meditation” wine, that won't appeal to everyone.",Badde Nigolosu Tenores,86,80.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Romangia,,Cannonau,Tenute Dettori

US,"Dark as a moonless midnight, dry as dust, with hard-edged tannins, this Cabernet is almost undrinkable now in its extreme youth. It shows a massive core of blackberries, currants, dark baker's chocolate and smoky oak, and the balance of acidity makes it clean and bright. All indications are of a cellarworthy wine. Drink 2014 and beyond.",Reserve Speciale,92,110.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
Spain,"Funky and smelling of pine and tarragon. That aromatic sharpness carries straight to the palate, where the feel is narrow and the flavors are short and tangy, with little to no big-time berry fruit.

US,"Why a 2005 vintage Merlot from this excellent vineyard is just being released six years later is one of those mysteries of wine. But it's a fine bottle, with plenty of life ahead. The tannins are softening up, and the fruit is smooth and ripe, with berries and plums and cassis. There is a generous wash of caramel and mocha also, and it's well-integrated and drinking at its peak.",Spofford Station Estate,88,18.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,JLC

Could develop for a few years.",,89,33.0,California,Marin County,North Coast,Pinot Noir,Kendric

US,"There seems to be a great deal of new oak here, to judge by the fresh, strong aromas of vanilla, cedar and smoky char, but those scents mesh well with the cassis, mocha, peat and anise that come from fruit.

Italy,"Lovers of traditional Amarone can appreciate a pinch of volatility (it sometimes appears as apple or cider) because it can add vibrancy, buoyancy and life to a wine when applied in measured doses.

I applaud the innovation, and the care given to its extra aging, but confess puzzlement as to what exactly this wine is intended to be.

Good, serviceable Merlot at a fair price.",,86,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Preston

US,"The aromas on this bottling from just outside the coastal town of Cambria start with slightly boozy vanilla and caramel-corn characters, followed by a bit of salinity and tart green apple.

The wine shows an old-fashioned ruggedness and the kind of in-your-face tannins and grapeskin astringency you don't see much anymore. Yet it's massively fruity and will age well.

The fruit flavors weave together black cherry, fig and currant, beautifully integrated with the bacon fat notes from the new French oak.

Chile,"Quite Bordeaux in style, meaning the wine is leaner, tighter and more tannic than typical Southern Hemisphere blends usually amount to. But we very much like the wine's mineral, plum and juicy raspberry flavors. All in all, expect a sturdy, well-made wine with plenty of natural and barrel-aided tannins. Will likely improve with another year or two in bottle.",Los Vascos Reserve,88,21.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)
US,"Quite yellow in color, nearing orange, this oxidative-style wine shows quinine, walnuts and preserved lemons on the very concentrated, oily nose.

It's quite an interesting bottling for fans of the style.",Sierra Mar Vineyard,88,40.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Bernardus
US,"Tastes a bit remote and hard now, with a steely minerality that accentuates the acidity, and even boosts the tannins. Underneath that are clean, vibrant pineapple, Meyer lemon, golden apricot and lime flavors. This is one of the rare California Chardonnays that should improve with some age.

Hungary,"The price is a bit steep for this attractive Bordeaux blend from Hungary, but it does deliver on many levels.

It still tastes very young, so cellar it or decant it.",Seven Hills Vineyard,89,40.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Januik
France,"A wine that shows an airy character. It is very open and fresh, the white fruits floating over a creamy texture and made crisp by grapefruit skin and bitter orange flavors.

Spain,"Not an expressive Rueda but it sizzles. Despite being young and driving, it's more neutral in flavor and texture than the winery's Verdejo, which is excellent.

US,"Spicy cranberry and rhubarb flavors hold down the center, and the rest is fleshed out with herb, leaf, beet root and earth.

Spain,"Peach and melon aromas are inviting and clean. Very juicy and juice-like in the mouth, probably more so than I can remember for this wine. It tastes like orange, tangerine and grapefuit juices mixed together.

A powerhouse Malbec and maybe the best Ultra to date.",Ultra,92,20.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Kaiken
US,"Not one of the best Cabs from this venerable winery. Despite a cool vintage, there's a burnt edge to the blackberry pie filling flavors.

The wine was made with free run juice, which gives it very pure, strong fruit flavors and almost none of the earthiness you might want for balance in a complex red wine. It's also very new oaky.

A “racimo” in Spanish is a bunch, so the name refers to the three or so grape bunches that each vine produces.",Hiru 3 Racimos,93,118.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Luis Cañas

US,"This Syrah was aged in 100% new oak, two thirds American and one third French. Barrel flavors abound, especially vanilla, and the fruit seems a bit overshadowed at this point in time. The tannins are aggressive, and overall this young wine seems to need more time in bottle to smooth out.",Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Reserve Syrah,90,55.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Côtes de Ciel
Spain,"This is a great wine, from a vintage that wasn't great. The nose is smooth and rich, with raspberry, plum, fine oak and all the spice that comes with it. The palate feels fresh and healthy, with racy blackberry fruit tempered by creamy chocolate, vanilla and spice. Like most high-end wines from the Eguren family, this is right on the money. Drink now through 2018.",La Nieta,93,159.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
Austria,"This is a beautiful wine with lemon and bitter-honey notes that exibits both balanced acidity and richness. Botrytis at the core shows amazing intensity with a palate that's concentrated and full. Citrus freshness dominates the long, lingering aftertaste. The wine should age well so drink from 2017.",Nummer 7 Trockenbeerenauslese,94,,Burgenland,,,Welschriesling,Kracher

Shows dry, oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, green apples and pears, with a firm minerality.",Corral Vineyard,90,46.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse

Spain,"Stalky black cherry and cedar aromas are persuasive enough, but this Crianza also comes with less impressive scents of wet dog and burnt black fruits. Big, tannic and rough on the palate, this tastes of earthy plum, black pepper and bitterness. A drawing, tannic finish brings additional burnt, roasted flavors.",Crianza,87,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ramirez de la Piscina
Chile,"As in previous years, this wine delivers earthy, proprietary aromas and flavors on a structured frame. The palate has forward berry and plum flavors, while the feel is rich, only mildly tannic and 100% healthy. Never does it sag, and with adequate acidity it doesn't lack for purpose or a finish line.

France,"It is not easy to describe one of the majestic wines of France. This 2007 is still a wine in the making. All the elements are there: the intensity of dry fruits, the richness of spice and white fruit jams, opulent and austere at the same time.

Has qualities but not a harmonious wine.",Reserva,85,13.0,Limarí Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña Ochotierras
US,"From owner/winemaker Kathy Joseph, the wine has subdued tartness on the nose, and green apple and citrus elements on the palate. Stone fruit emerges quickly when poured, but the wine loses such nuance as it sits in the glass.

Israel,"Restrained aromas of black plum barely set the stage for flavors of dark plum, cherry-vanilla, mint eucalyptus and ground black pepper.

US,"If only this wine had greater structure, it would earn a higher score, but as it is, it's too soft and sugary, which makes it taste like the filling of a pie or tart.

Austria,"St. Laurent is a speciality at Johanneshof Reinisch (they make 4 different wines from this varietal).

US,"More than the tight and tannic 2005 Corliss Red, this Cabernet Sauvignon is immediately fragrant and open, with a mix of sweet fruit and sweet oak. Black cherry, cassis, subtle notes of lavender, and a foundation of wet stone are all nicely balanced and surprisingly elegant, given the relatively high (15.1%) alcohol. This wine seems now to be entering its prime time—it benefits from decanting, and will cellar well, but should probably be consumed within the next 2–8 years.",,93,75.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Corliss Estates

US,"Tastes unevenly ripened, with a thyme and peppermint jelly green quality side by side with blackberry jam and blueberry pie filling. The wine also straddles the border of dry and raisiny, Porty-sweet. In its own curious way, it's complex.",,87,26.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ferrari-Carano
US,"This is immediately attractive in blackberry, cherry and red currant flavors, with a subtle coating of smoky oak. With plenty of elegance, it's wonderful for drinking now.

US,"Starts out with aromas that are pretty typical of inexpensive California Merlots: earth, plums and blackberries, with no noticeable oak. The aromas are dull; they don't shine. The flavors are good, though. Sharply etched fruit forces itself on the palate, ripe, sweet and brimming with sunshine. This is simple, everyday stuff, but it's clean as a whistle and has a good amount of charm. Definitely a value in Merlot. Best Buy.",Vineyard Reserve,85,10.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,Bandiera
US,"Onesta is Jillian Johnson's debut of her own wines; she previously made Cinsault-based reds and rosés for the Phoenix Ranch brand. She is not new, however, to the indelible Bechthold Vineyard and its ancient Cinsault grapes, and her passion and expertise with the site shows gorgeously here. Orange-pink in hue, this beauty shares notes of crushed strawberry that are perfectly in balance with its dry, elegant point-of-view. Sip this one all night long, with food or without.",Bechthold Vineyard,92,18.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Rosé,Onesta

US,"A very lovely blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with rich flavors and classic dryness. Shows delicious blackberry, black cherry, currant and dried herb flavors, touched with smoky oak, and wrapped into gentle tannins.

US,"Thick, chewy, dense and powerful. The blend is 75% Merlot, 15% Cab Franc, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. A very fine effort, it's smooth and supple, with alcohol listed (somewhat surprisingly) at 13.5%. Scents mix mocha, espresso, liquid smoke, iodine and black licorice; flavors also run to black and smoky. But there is fruit as well, deep black cherry and cassis, tightly packed and lingering.",,91,38.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Donedei

Try as an alternative to a good Cabernet.",Cutt,88,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Hunnicutt

It is full bodied and rich in texture.",Arrastre,88,28.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Rhône-style Red Blend,Legendre

Decanting is essential.",Reserve,89,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Waterbrook

Chile,"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Grande Vidure, 20% Petite Syrah and 10% Merlot, it is as if you can clearly account for each varietal's contribution. Ripe cassis, cherry, plum, and spice flavors are buttressed by well-integrated oak.  Beautifully balanced, it has good acidity and mature tannins, and closes with a long, satisfying finish.

US,"The winery's first Cab, this is made from a blend of Pepper Bridge and Bacchus fruit, with a smattering of Red Mountain Merlot.

US,"All estate-grown and barrel fermented, this ripe and delicious white wine opens with scents of sweet hay, then is quickly wrapped in flavors of lemon zest, grapefruit and candied citrus. There's a dusty note as well, and the richness keeps bringing in more nuances—of English Breakfast tea, sweet stone fruits and lightly tropical papaya.

US,"The most floral of Ponzi's single-vineyard Pinots, this is a delicate and yet powerful wine, scented with lavender and roses, and displaying bright, clean raspberry fruit.

US,"There's beautiful fruit from a beautiful vineyard in here somewhere but first let there be oak, lots of it (100% new French), giving the wine a dark golden hue and the nose an interesting meaty, baked apple quality.

US,"The seductive, woodsy aroma and complex flavors of tea and cherry are true to the variety. With a medium body that doesn't overwhelm, it offers a firmly tannic and lively texture plus a long finish. Very little oak comes through, yet the grapes themselves offer great complexity.",Valenti Vineyard,91,47.0,California,Mendocino Ridge,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Drew

France,"Aged in a small proportion of new wood, this is a concentrated, sophisticated wine. It derives its character from the local Braucol and Duras grapes, blended with Syrah.

US,"A classic Bordeaux blend (about 30% each Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot, the rest Petite Verdot) This wine is still locked up tight upon release. There is metallic minerality underpinning the tart, austere fruit, but there are also surprising high notes of brandied cherries, and a sense of depth missing in more ordinary wines. This is definitely a wine to cellar for up to a decade. As always, this is sensitive, detailed winemaking.",Ciel du Cheval,90,30.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Seven Hills

US,"The Derby is pure, estate-grown, 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose is accented with hints of violets and roses, ripe berries, plums and licorice. Once tasted, it seems to hit a wall and just stop. Extra hours of breathing did not make a difference. Perhaps it needs more bottle age, but at the moment it does not broaden out or move into a finish with the sort of depth that this wine has demonstrated in the past.",Derby,88,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Spring Valley Vineyard

There is only a hint of the richness to come. Hold for 10 years at least.",Les Clos Grand Cru,97,95.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,William Fèvre
US,"This is solidly made, with rough, chewy tannins and hard fruit flavors that show concentrated plum and cassis. Everything is in good proportion, although the acids are a bit chalky and the high alcohol (just under 15%) takes it away from classic Bordeaux flavors. It would be nice to see the ripeness ramped down a notch, because the mix of grapes is right and there's good fruit here. It just has been ripened to the point where the alcohol takes over.",,86,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Meritage,DiStefano

US,"Soft, luscious and bold, this velvety Cabernet brings great credentials, sourced from vineyards virtually adjoining Champoux.

US,"This is a very rich, and perhaps ageable, Cabernet Sauvignon, made with one-fifth Cabernet Franc. Grown from Calistoga grapes, it's soft enough to drink now, with chocolaty flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and mint. Lots of new oak adds caramel and smoky vanilla, but the wine is powerful enough to handle them. Give it through 2010 to integrate.",,90,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cali 351

Argentina,"Of all the large-format White Pearl varietals, this Torrontes tastes and feels the best. It has the grape's pungent aromas of acacia and talc, and the flavors are solid and persistent as the palate yields green melon and honey. Finishes tangy and fresh, meaning it hasn't yet started to fade.",White Pearl,85,13.0,Other,Salta,,Torrontés,Antonio Cesar Cavalli
US,"High alcohol of 20% makes this dessert wine hot in the mouth. That's the main impression, because the sweetness and fruit aren't quite strong enough to balance the heat.

US,"The cool 2011 vintage has kept this bottling from being as ripe as previous wines from this producer. It's certainly leaner, but for all that, it's dry, silky and elegantly complex in its own way, with dried raspberry, tea and white pepper flavors. It could surprise after 2017.",Bella Una,91,56.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Benovia

Chile,"Starts out grapey and big, but soon it finds its focus. The palate is wide and fruity, with balanced tannins and acidity propping up black grape and blackberry flavors.

New Zealand,"This winery hasn't fared all that well in recent vintages, but hopefully the 2007 represents a step in the right direction. The overly pungent, grassy notes have been replaced by riper, more balanced fruit that calls to mind honey, melon and fig yet finishes dry and minerally. A bit tarry and rubbery when first opened, so a quick decant is recommended.",,88,19.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Wairau River
Spain,"Having really liked this wine a couple of years ago, this vintage seems comparatively fierce and aggressive, which isn't to say it isn't hugely flavorful and aromatic.

Tough as nails; maybe it just needs a couple of years to settle.",,88,90.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Paixar
US,"Anyone who doesn't love this Pinot just doesn't understand California's approach. It's a fantastically delicious wine, completely satisfying in raspberry, cherry, persimmon, toast, spice and vanilla flavors, and balanced with bright, coastal acidity.

Australia,"This prodigious wine showcases Barossa's ability to deliver big, mouthfilling flavors without any suggestion of heat or heaviness. Scents of stone fruit, pepper and red currants mark the nose, while the flavors take on a darker cast, heading toward black cherries and black olives.

US,"A zesty blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this shows melon, tuberose, white lily and sharp lemon zest on the nose.

Chile,"Herbal red-fruit aromas come across scratchy and suggestive of fresh field greens.

US,"I love this for its absolute dryness and crispness and minerally depth. There's something coldly metallic in the taste and mouthfeel, and to the extent there's fruit, it's of grapefruits and lime zest, with a flowery exoticness.

US,"This important Pinot Noir is expensive, but it is absolutely worth a search. It's not a single-vineyard wine, but a blend of various blocks from the cooler southern part of the valley. Oak, to the tune of 70% new, is very strong in char and vanilla, but way stronger is the fruit itself, which is exemplary and stunning. Raspberries, cherries and strawberries just begin to describe it, with all sorts of spice and earth complexities. Stuns with purity, complexity and sheer delicious power.

Argentina,"Standard all the way, but isn't that what we want from a $9 wine? The nose offers raspberry and strawberry aromas, while the flavors are generic but familiar, with a lean toward cherry and berry. Solid on the finish, and fairly intense as a whole. Imported by Clock Tower Imports.",,86,9.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"Smells brambly, sour and muddy, and that's a fair indicator of what's to come. The palate is astringent and seemingly acidified, and the wine's core plum and berry flavors are weedy and murky. Not very appealing.",Vástago de Gea,82,15.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Staphyle
Australia,"A top-notch effort, this is the sort of wine that should shatter existing stereotypes of Australian Shiraz. Savory notes of smoked meat and espresso combine with blackberry fruit and scents of violets, and while the wine is clearly concentrated, it weighs in at only 13% alcohol. Drink 2012-2020.",Reserve Release,91,55.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Syrah,De Bortoli
US,"The blend is 60-40 Grenache-Syrah, and the name comes from French slang for something that is luxurious, really chic. Sappy, grapy, nicely lifted and vivacious, this is a beautiful mix of fruits in a spectrum from watermelon to strawberry to red plum to raspberry and pie cherry. There's plenty of acid and just a whiff of pepper from the Syrah.",Byzance,89,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Grenache-Shiraz,Brian Carter Cellars
New Zealand,This is a medium- to full-bodied Pinot with plenty of concentration and ripeness. You get ripe black cherries upfront and all the way through the long finish—the only thing this wine really needs is more complexity. Pretty good value.,Boulder Bank,88,20.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Nick Goldschmidt
US,"The vineyard is in the northeastern Salinas Valley, in the Gavilan foothills, which makes it a cool climate.

France,"Gorgeously nuanced nose, with almond, marzipan, melon, lime and fresia up front, set against a palate of Brazil nut and cinnamon toast.

France,"Deliciously rich and fruity, this is a wine that shows that Clos de Vougeot is a great vineyard. It has all the ripeness, the big, generous fruit, supported by wood.

US,"“Whole cluster” refers to the fermentation practice of using intact clusters of grapes, rather than grapes that have been destemmed and crushed.

New Zealand,"Peppery and gingery upfront, delivering the spice that Gewürz is noted for, but in a slightly tame, restrained format backed by pineapple and pear flavors and a soft, off-dry finish.

Start with earth, seaweed, compost; bring in ripe berry fruit, vanilla, tobacco. That is the nose.

It has amazing length for a wine so young.",,88,24.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Mourvèdre,Willow Crest

Good Carmenère for those eager to give it a try.",Santa Digna Reserve,87,11.0,Central Valley,,,Carmenère,Miguel Torres
US,"A bit green and raw, like a cherry-chocolate-covered mint, but nicely dry and silky. For the price, a good introduction to Pinot Noir.",,84,8.0,California,California,California Other,Pinot Noir,Redtree
Argentina,"Shrap, prickly and sweaty smelling, much like Sauvignon Blanc or Spanish Verdejo. The palate is reflective of the nose: grapefruit and passion fruit along with sourness. Herbal and sour on the citric finish.",Malbec,81,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Rosé,Melipal
Chile,"Very rustic and aggressive, with savage aromas of leather and animal. Tastes more sour and herbal than fun and friendly. Barely acceptable and not a good example of affordable Chilean Carmenère.",Estate Selection,80,13.0,Curicó Valley,,,Carmenère,Aresti
France,"87-89 Barrel sample. Initially closed, the wine is tight, mineral, with tannins that are hard and dense. The fruit is perhaps too light for all this weight of structure.",Barrel sample,88,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Monbrison
Chile,"Crusty aromas of herb, tar, black olive and baked black fruit set up the jumpy, high-acid palate, with flavors of herbal berry fruits, accented by green bean and pepper. Overall it's a hard, baked and oaky wine, with a strong herbal tilt.",,85,20.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Arboleda
US,"Rich and ripe, with enormous blackberry, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors, wrapped into firm but smoothly complex tannins. A very good Cab that will develop nuances over the next 4–6 years.",,91,48.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hunnicutt
US,"Normally we don't remark on a wine's color or clarity, but this one is a throwback: rich golden-yellow and cloudy. Heavily toasted whole-wheat bread couples with earth and custard aromas, and then the lemon and tangerine flavors hit you on the palate. Finishes with some elegant lemon and clove notes.",DeRose Vineyard,90,34.0,California,Cienega Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Thunder Mountain
US,"Tough, acidic and tight in youth, offering little in the way of richness. So tart, so minerally, so dry. A wine that demands time in the cellar. Should reward the patient after six years or so, to allow things to resolve so the cherry, cranberry and rhubarb flavors can transmogrify. It would not be surprising for this wine to develop bottle nuance for well more than a decade.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,94,90.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Estate-grown and varietal, this has a youthful freshness and a pretty cherry flavor. The tannins are smooth and supple, and the wine is balanced and lightly citrusy. It falls off rather quickly and leaves a hint of herb on the finish.",,87,35.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Petit Verdot,Corvus
US,"A brilliant Syrah, showing its cool-climate origins with a burst of white pepper. Much of the fruit comes from the Bien Nacido Vineyard, and the Syrah contains 4% Viognier. Firm tannins and fine acidity give this delicious wine structure, but it's mostly notable for the extraordinary depth and length of its blackberry, currant, teriaki beef, mushroom and cedar flavors. The wine easily stands up to 100% new French oak casks.",The Oracle of Delphi,95,85.0,California,California,California Other,Syrah,Sanguis

Chile,"Edgy plum and berry aromas come with an herb accent, a spice note and a flower element. It comes across high in acidity, with shearing plum and cherry flavors that end with a feeling of citric acid. It's crisp and intense, but also tight as nails.",Edición Limitada,87,23.0,Loncomilla Valley,,,Carignan,Morandé
Chile,"Fairly fresh and fruity, with peach and cantaloupe on the nose. Next up is a plump palate with round melon flavors. A soft finish with creaminess indicates modest acidity. Shows toasty dryness in the middle. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Maquehua,87,18.0,Curicó Valley,,,Chardonnay,Miguel Torres
Italy,"A certified organic wine, this offers easy berry aromas of cherry and raspberry that would pair with informal foods like pizza. The mouthfeel is lean and bright.",Primi Soli,85,,Southern Italy,Puglia,,Primitivo,Cielo e Terra
US,"Awkward. Despite some cherry jam and candied licorice flavors, accented by quite a bit of oak, there's a semi-sweet sharpness in the finish reminiscent of cough medicine, and a touch of sweaty funk.",Sonoma Mountain-Top Vineyards,83,54.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bush-Field
US,"Coming in at 12.8% alcohol—nearly unheard of for a Washington red, particularly in a warm vintage—it brings appealing notes of dark plum accented by black pepper and dried herbs. It's silky soft in feel with a dazzling sense of texture and purity with little apparent oak influence.",Dineen Vineyard,91,27.0,Washington,Rattlesnake Hills,Columbia Valley,Malbec,Savage Grace
Argentina,"Full, warm and rubbery on the nose, and then chewy and round in the mouth. Flavors of plum and baked berry hint at tomato and a full and varied herb basket, while the finish is soft and slightly baked. Good Malbec but slightly heavy.",Premium,86,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alta Vista
Chile,"The price for Floresta has never been higher and frankly the wine has never been more green and tough. For starters, 2004 was a cool year in Chile, and that's evidenced here. The wine has a near-vegetal streak on the nose and palate, and the fruit is tart while the feel is hard.",Floresta Apalta,84,55.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Rita
US,"Estate-grown Viognier makes up the majority of this blend, followed by 25% Roussanne and 22% Marsanne.

France,"The high toast aromas and flavors dominate the wine's fruit character, ripe as it is. But that fruit is potentially delicious, with citrus, pineapple fruits and a crisp, taut edge. It needs several months of bottle age. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Le Clos,89,57.0,Burgundy,Pouilly-Fuissé,,Chardonnay,Château de Fuissé
US,"You might mistake this for a good Dry Creek Zinfandel, it's so briary, brambly and peppery. The fruit is all about red cherries and rec currants, pure and refined, wrapped into dusty tannins. A nice, dry, full-bodied red wine.",,90,35.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Mounts

Italy,"Made with Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera, this concentrated wine conveys aromas of perfumed berry and cake spice. The ripe, round palate offers crushed raspberry, wild cherry, clove and licorice alongside firm, velvety tannins.",Riserva,88,17.0,Southern Italy,Salice Salentino,,Red Blend,Cantine Paolo Leo
Italy,"In a year where so many Barbarescos are heavy and slightly plummy, this is lighter and the fruit aromas are more primary. On the palate the flavors show elements of wild strawberries, lavender and smoke, and the wine is balanced and finishes well. A really pleasant Barbaresco that will evolve for a few more years.",,88,36.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Giribaldi
Chile,"Big, bold, wild and dark, with mild burnt aromas backed by broad blackberry and plum flavors.

It's not flawless but its pounding fruit character will earn its share of fans.",Reserva,85,9.0,Maule Valley,,,Syrah,Chilensis
Spain,"On the plus side, there's a smoky, meaty set of aromas. But on the down side, there's a rubbery character reminiscent of burnt tire tread. That rubbery element passes through to the flavors, which also bring roasted berry into the fold. Rustic stuff with just enough bold berry fruit to make it worth a go.",Arderius Crianza Vendimia Seleccionada,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Leza García
Germany,"While demure and mineral at first whiff, this revitalizing Riesling blossoms on the nose as it aerates, accumulating layers of citrus and floral aromas.

US,"This is a light, leafy wine, with tannins that taste of green tea and leave a sensation of astringency long after the wine is swallowed. Sounds like Burgundy!

US,"Youthful, plummy, bright, clear and very toasty. The new oak jumps out at you, but then the fruit stands up to it.

France,"For white Hermitage, this is tight and minerally, with more structure than Chapoutier's other microcuvées and possibly more aging potential.

Finishes with tremendous length and minerality.",L'Ermite,95,260.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,M. Chapoutier
Spain,"Light berry and sugar cookie aromas kick it off, followed by peach pit and nectarine flavors.

Straightforward but solid.",Reinares,85,8.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Rosé,Bodegas Eguren

US,"Serious Cabernet, rich and complex and full bodied, made from Knights Valley and Alexander Valley fruit, with a few grapes from Atlas Peak and Mount Veeder.

Israel,"With 80% Petite Sirah and 20% Zinfandel, this is a juicy, lush red with a solid structure, moderate gripping tannins and a long finish.

US,"As rich as Napa Cab gets. Made solidly in the modern style, it's soft, elaborate and flamboyant, suggesting ultraripe blackberry pie, currant, mocha-choca and sweet oak flavors.

US,"Thick, ripe, creamy and luscious, this 15.4% Sémillon carries itself with grace and style. The dense fruit flavors mix peaches, apricots, pears and spicy apples; with a hint of caramel and brown sugar. Though quite dry, it has so much fruit as to seem lightly sweet, and the high alcohol does not take away from the complexity.

US,"A very good, richly tannic wine that flatters with strong flavors of blackberries, cherries and oak. It may be a little too ripe for its own good, though, as it's pretty jammy.

Good length for such a tart wine.",LEHM Estate,88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Chelan Wine Company
US,"Give this Cabernet some time in the cellar. Right now, it's a little tough in acids and tannins, although the blackberry, cherry, black currant and smoky oak flavors are rich and fine and enjoyable now.

Argentina,"Sharp, spiky and raw to start, with sassy fruit and aromas of smoked meat and polished leather. In the mouth, more identifiable flavors of plum, raspberry and beet take over, and time allows for it to unfold. Finishes sturdy, with perfect tannins and perky acids.

US,"A lovely Cabernet, rich and ripe in blackberries and cassis, with a touch of herbs and a little heat from high alcohol. A good steak, with its salty fattiness, will take care of that.

Spain,"Slightly rooty and warm, with a nose that's one part stewy and malty and another part complex and fruity.

France,"Yes, it's pricey for a Côtes-d-Rhône, but it's also excellent, and worth cellaring for a year or two prior to consumption.

A long, dry, stylish and tangy finish is squarely old school in character.",Reserva,88,19.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Red Blend,Príncipe de Viana
France,"In Champagne-speak, Extra Dry means sweeter than Brut, so this is a soft wine, fruity rather than mineral. Pear and fresh green plum flavors are balanced by orange zest and final acidity.

The softness makes it gentle and easy to enjoy now, with its delicious flavors of blackberries, cherries, black raspberries, plums and milk chocolate.",Judge Family Vineyard,90,29.0,California,Bennett Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
US,"Though found in some Chardonnays, there's a heaviness to this wine, with its orange Muscat nose and syrupy flavors, that seems out of sync here. The wine seems to flop onto the palate and sit there, without much progression. Needs more acid and a lighter touch.",Reserve,82,20.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Standing Stone
US,"Sweet, soft and delicious, this is a rich Zinfandel to savor with barbeque. It's tasty in blackberry, cherry and blueberry fruit, with a coating of smoky oak.

Spain,"Big and yellow, which is evidence of the oak aging on this plump, modern Verdejo that's made in small quantity and will appeal to those who like things such as Sémillon and Chenin Blanc. The body is full, there's fruit, weight and grip, and the ripeness versus minerality is just right. Drink now with cheese or fish. 300 cases produced.",Naiades,89,28.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Naia

US,"The Horse Heaven vineyard has been producing exceptional Sauvignon Blancs for the past decade. In this unusual vintage, which started very cool and lasted through an extended, late harvest, the grapes ripened to perfection. Ripe, lush fruit gets some added creaminess from barrel fermentation and aging sur lie. There are scents of lime, citrus peel, wet stone and spice, leading to a wonderfully full, focused panoply of flavors in the mouth. The finish goes on forever.

Spain,"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily.

Argentina,"A big wine, but some persistent sulphur and earthiness on the nose results in aromas of leather, scrambled eggs and tobacco. Rugged on the palate, but that's to be expected for a big-boned Malbec like this. Flavors of blackberry and black cherry are supported by powerful oak, leather and an infusion of herbs.

US,"It would take an entire review to list all the varieties in this wine, but it's mainly Carignane, Petite Sirah and Sangiovese. It's really good, and proves that Randall Grahm continues to march to his own beat. Not for him lush, ripe fruit, but leanness, acidity, elegance, structure and what you might call style.

US,"This wine is still young and precocious, but don't judge it too quickly. Let it air in your glass, and watch how it changes. One minute it's all cherries and smoke; the next it heaves up a great draught of currants, cocoa and cedar. It's a big wine but deceptive; the tannins are airy and lilting, there's charm and underneath, enormous complexity. It's best left alone for a few more years, but it's really very lovely now.",Private Reserve,95,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer

US,"Cherries, black raspberries, red currants and licorice formulate the heart of this generous wine. It's silky in tannins, with an easy mouthfeel that makes it drinkable now, and also has brisk, arching acidity.

US,"It was barrel-fermented, using wild yeasts, and aged on the lees. The vineyard is in the coolest part of Napa Valley, and in this cool vintage, acidity is the most important part of the wine. Crisp and biting, it lends structural authority to the Meyer lemon, lime, tangerine, fig, mineral, vanilla and white pepper flavors. The alcohol level has been kept to a modest 13.8%. A welcome addition to California's Sauvignon Blanc pantheon.",Heart Block,94,50.0,California,Yountville,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Source Napa
US,"Pungency and zest is what this wine is all about. The nose is sharp and angular, with cat pee, green melon and citrus, while the palate is crisp and intense, with peach skin, tangerine, lime and mineral notes. Deep and rock solid on the finish, with an aftertaste one taster labeled as “like chicken.” Maybe he was subliminally referring to the perfect food pairing for this zippy white.",,89,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,St. Supéry
US,"Grgich has struggled with this uneven bottling over the years, and the 2003 shows the problems that have plagued the wine.

US,"This single-vineyard Chardonnay impresses for its taut structure and promise of aging. It's totally dry, and beneath that slate and metal is a core of ripe yellow peach.

Spain,"Questionable value at $70, but this is very good and rather unique white Rioja. Remelluri uses a multitude of common and unheard-of grapes, and they hit it with a lot of oak. Still, amid the oily richness there's balance, acidity and excellent layering of grass, spice, apple, banana and lemon flavors.

Chile,"Attractive and very much in the vein of what is really good Chilean Sauvignon Blanc. The bouquet is all about green herbs, cactus pad, passion fruit and citrus. The palate transitions from lemon-lime to tropical pineapple and passion fruit, while the finish is breezy and zesty.

Also prominent are minerals, flowers and herbs.",,90,40.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Demetria

France,"A charged Burgundy, packed with dense tannins and powerful ripe black berry fruits.

Austria,"A wine that pairs with Gesellmann's Bela Rex Bordeaux blend.

Italy,"It's safe to say that Gianfranco Soldera's style is only appreciated and understood by Brunello purists. The wines are as thorny and complex as the argumentative, cantankerous man who makes them. For one, this wine has big volatility but the magic here is that those pungent direct aromas translate into bright aromatic vibrancy and buoyancy.

Hovering above it all is grated lemon zest, pulling fruit, texture and freshness tautly together in a dry, fresh yet mellow finish.

Australia,"This big, broad-shouldered Shiraz is brimming with flavor and ready to drink now.

Finishes with a kiss of chocolate.",,89,36.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Aubichon Cellars
US,"A dramatic wine, authoritative in tannins, bone dry and noble. Withholds its best under a cloak of astringency, but already shows its mountain terroir in the complexity of its structure and deep, intense blackberry, currant, blueberry and dried herb flavors. Should develop bottle complexities for at least a decade and probably longer.",Monument Ridge,96,45.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet

US,"Though the alcohol comes close to 15%, this is still relatively light compared with other Spofford vineyard Syrahs.

US,"Showing quite a bit of tannins and acids, this is a very young wine, of a kind that isn't seen all that much in Russian River Valley these days.

US,"DeLille's D2 red (51% Merlot/38% Cabernet Sauvignon/8% Cab Franc/3% Petit Verdot) is a declassified wine in the best possible sense—the grapes come from all of the winery's premier vineyard sources. The result is a substantial, even meaty red wine, muscular rather than plump. The fruit is layered and tart, its flavors laced with smoke, tar and licorice.

A bit of kerosene marks the nose, alongside scents of spice and bergamot, while the flavors run toward apple and citrus.

Australia,"Perhaps better known for its Chardonnay, Leeuwin also makes an Art Series Cabernet that takes a back seat to no one.

US,"This is Duckhorn's signature vineyard for Merlot, located off the Silverado Trail below Calistoga. It's also the winery's most variable Merlot, showing distinct vintage variation. The 2004 was a warm vintage, and the wine is soft and voluptuous in pie-filling cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But it doesn't have the tough tannins that cooler vintages show.",Three Palms Vineyard,88,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Duckhorn
US,"This is one of the most successful Pinots the winery has produced, and I have no doubt it's because the vintage was so cool. The wine is absolutely dry and has bracing acidity, with extraordinarily long, deep flavors of grapes that achieved maximum ripeness but remain balanced.

US,"A six-grape Rhône blend, this does not lose focus or intensity. It strikes the palate head-on with flavors of dried leaf, prune, cooked cherry, cinnamon and mocha. But despite the raisin/prune flavors, it does not seem overripe or in any way over the hill. Rather, these superripe flavors have somehow been tamed, the alcohol is just over 14%, and the wine leaves a sinuous, sensuous trail of flavor as it moves through the palate.",Rouge des Coteaux,90,18.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Rhône-style Red Blend,Olsen Estates

US,"Sweet and viscous, this blend of Chardonnay, Sémillon, Moscato and Viognier is forward in fruit flavors, mostly tropical and stone fruit. The Viognier sweetness doesn't linger too long on the finish and it would be very sippable stone cold on a hot day.",White Blend,87,10.0,California,California,California Other,White Blend,un4seen
US,"This has pure fruit – strawberry especially – creating an elegant, light, delicate, complex, though still quite young wine. Some caraway seed flavors come into play, and bolder black cherry fruit.",Maresh Vineyard,93,50.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Kelley Fox
Italy,"Packaged in an extremely heavy bottle, this opulent Amarone delivers knockout aromas of toasted almond, hickory smoke, pipe tobacco and spice. Fruit flavors of plum, prune and blackberry are followed by a much-needed touch of acidity that keeps the palate refreshed.",Tenuta Valleselle Aurum,90,25.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Tinazzi
Spain,"Ribera is not prime rosé country, and this wine doesn't much help the cause. Cherry cough drop aromas are about all you're going to get, while the palate is jumpy and sour, with apple skin and grapefruit flavors. Too much like a sucking candy.",Monte Castrillo Rosado,82,13.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Rosé,Finca Torremilanos
Portugal,"A pear-and pineapple-flavored wine, lifted with bright fresh acidity. There is a smooth texture that comes from ripe fruit. Drink now to enjoy its crispness.",Branco,86,,Alentejano,,,Portuguese White,Casa de Santa Vitoria
US,"Another flavorful Chard from a fine region and vintage. Aromas of tropical fruits, spices, oak, smoke and lees. Rich and fine in the mouth. The structure is particularly elegant, with crisp acidity, smooth tannins and alcohol all well integrated with the fruit. Gets extra points for harmony and balance.",,88,15.0,California,Santa Barbara,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Domaine Santa Barbara
US,"Tastes a bit raw and herbal in the mouth, like a piece of celery, although there are also richer blackberry and cherry flavors. Yet it's a dry, elegantly constructed Cabernet. Best soon, before the fruit disappears.",,86,52.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jordan
US,"Gewürz is practically an endangered species in California, and this wine does nothing to advance the cause. It's soft, simple and watery, with off-dry flavors of gingerbread, spices, oranges and vanilla.",,84,19.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Gewürztraminer,Thomas Fogarty
France,"A fresh rosé, so crisp, bright and lively. This is real pleasure, the red berry fruits bursting out of the glass, lifted by delicious acidity. Very crisp, pure in taste.",Vieilles Vignes,91,,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière
Italy,"This Taurasi opens with earthy aromas of leather, mature black fruit and a whiff of barnyard. The palate offers bracing tannins and dense flavors of blackberry, black cherry and sugar plum that are layered with sugary-sweet vanilla, oak, toast and coffee.",,88,34.0,Southern Italy,Taurasi,,Aglianico,Donnachiara
US,"Ripe and tasty, with cassis, cherries and sweet new oak flavors. But it has a sweaty, funky smell, and is excessively soft, making the wine melted and flat.",Lone Canyon Vineyard,84,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ladera
Spain,"Creamy aromas of custard give off a soapy smell. This feels citric, while nectarine and orange flavors are a bit funky. On the finish, this is more fresh and direct than flavorful.",Brut Nature,86,15.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Camps d'Estels
US,"From a great vintage, a tight, young Cab just beginning to hit its stride. Grown in the cooler Coombsville area, south of Stags Leap, the wine is bright and brisk in both acids and tannins that give it firm structure. But it's enormously rich in cassis and cherry fruit, and seems to have a good lifespan. Good now, and should live into the next decade.",Parsley Family Estates,92,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Silver Stag
US,"This has acids and tannins and plenty of structure. The winemaker is aiming at an ageworthy, more classic wine. It needs time, or at the very least, serious decanting. But the stuffing is there. Hold until 2010.",,89,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Karl Lawrence
France,"Pleasant, with broad appeal, this wine opens with Poire William, mineral and rose notes, followed by Asian spice on the tongue. There's noticeable sweetness here but a spicy character keeps it from being cloying. Serve with Pad Thai. Drink now.",,86,12.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Helfrich
Italy,"A tart mouthfeel with layers of cherry and cranberry fruit is enhanced by this bubbly Lambrusco's dark ruby color. This is a dry expression with plump, fruity density in the mouth.",Granarossa,84,16.0,Central Italy,Emilia,,Lambrusco,Bertolani
US,"Mostly Merlot, this powerful wine delivers Red Mountain grip and guts. The generous bourbon barrel accents from oak aging are balanced by the concentrated fig, plum and blackberry fruit. A seam of graphite runs through the tannins.",Artz and Shaw,91,39.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Adams Bench
US,"This is mostly Syrah, but has a splash each of Grenache and Petite Sirah as well. It's solid and generous, though less compelling than either the Merlot or the Cabernet from Milbrandt. Strong vanilla and tobacco flavors overtake the fruit, and the earthy tannins lack focus, but it's fair value.",Traditions,87,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Milbrandt
US,"This is a soft, easy wine, with sweet black raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Drink now with a nice homemade cheeseburger.",,84,25.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Curtis
US,"A light but flavorful and dry bubbly, this has a pale pink color and frothy effervescence. Aromas like red cherries and peaches lead to tasty, lively fruit flavors. It has a refreshing, tart texture that's not too severe, and a soft finish.",Brut Rosé,88,36.0,California,Yorkville Highlands,North Coast,Malbec,Yorkville Cellars
US,"Always one of the superstar Sauv Blancs from Washington, this is especially good in this vintage. Lots of toast, butter cookie and a streak of vanilla are wrapped into silky, seductive, ripe fruit flavors that mix citrus, orange, papaya and lemon hard candy. This is about 20% Sémillon, barrel fermented.",Stillwater Creek Vineyard,92,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Novelty Hill
Argentina,"The bouquet is fairly tight, with aromas of coffee, crushed minerals, crude oil and fine herbs. The palate runs snappier than most high-end Malbecs, but it also delivers on the promise of ripeness and black-fruit flavors. Finishes in healthy fashion, with some slickness and speed. Very nice and likely even better with food. 1,000 cases made. Imported by Slocum & Sons.",Edicion Limitada,88,45.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
US,"This cuvée reflects the lean vintage with modest alcohol and slightly dilute fruit flavors. Pretty aromatics suggest rosewater and sandalwood, and the wine fades gracefully with plum and cherry fruit.",Dundee Hills Vineyards,88,38.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Winderlea
US,"The grapes from this wine come mainly from older blocks in the To Kalon Vineyard, adjoining the winery. It contains 5% Sémillon. The wine is graceful and elegant in the mouth, with bracing acidity and a minerality that reminds you of cold, wet stones. Yet there are flavors of citrus fruits and white flowers. Dense and complex, this full-bodied wine is best enjoyed not too cold.",To Kalon Vineyard Reserve,92,40.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Fumé Blanc,Robert Mondavi
US,"Firm and juicy, this old vine Cabernet is loaded with black fruits. With just 1% Merlot in the blend, it's a generous mouthful of almost-pure Cabernet, layered with licorice, mineral, and intense fruit flavors of currant and cherry.",Cold Creek Vineyard,92,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"A good effort, with clean varietal character: lemon/lime skin flavors, sharp acidity and cool, green fruit throughout.",Vie!,87,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Vin du Lac
Australia,"This wine boasts fantastic spice-drop character on the nose, seamlessly blending bold blackberry and plum fruit with notes of anise and licorice. It's lush and richly textured in the mouth, with a long, spice-driven finish. A wine that's wonderfully exotic and approachable now, but one that should last up to 10 years.",Blewitt Springs,93,70.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Grenache,Clarendon Hills
Italy,"This delivers much more than standard Pinot Grigio. There's thickness and density here all backed by fragrant aromas of stone fruit, citrus and chopped almonds. The mouthfeel is creamy and thick. Pair with lemon-marinated chicken.",Gris,88,30.0,Northeastern Italy,Friuli Isonzo,,Pinot Grigio,Lis Neris
US,"Very dry, with crisp acidity, this blush wine is a bit too full-bodied for true elegance. Yet it has a certain polish, and the cherry, Mandarin orange and spice flavors are rich and savory.",Rosé of,84,18.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Ampelos
US,"This Chardonnay is so delicious in citrus, tropical fruit, peach and vanilla bean flavors, brightened with brisk acidity, that you hardly miss the absence of oak.",Metallico Un-Oaked,89,20.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Morgan
US,"A good, robust, everyday Zinfandel, with some special features. It's soft and dry and very flavorful, offering waves of raspberries, cherries, mocha, spices and sandalwood. Gets a few extra points for the finely ground tannins and clean, brisk scour of acidity.",Steinbeck Vineyard - Wine-Bush Vineyard,88,24.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Eberle
Austria,"Seriously savory watercress and yeast notes take the aromatic lead. The palate follows suit with pepperiness and lemony, citric verve. Zippy, lively and fresh, but with weight and resonance.",Grand Grü Reserve,90,29.0,Kamptal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Steininger
France,"91-93 Barrel sample. Firm tannins, with some extract, bitter chocolate, dark coffee, almost dry tannins, very dense in character.",Barrel sample,92,,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Girolate
New Zealand,"A medium-bodied, off-dry style, with scents of baked apples and vegetable oil followed by flavors of apple and peach accented by peppery cinnamon-tinged spice. It's slightly creamy in texture, with a long, mouthcoating finish. Drink now.",Reserve Selection Classic,90,24.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Jawbone
Australia,"While this wine isn't lacking concentration, its aromas are of stewed and overcooked fruit and it turns a bit sharp on the finish. No improvement with age.",Steeple Jack,81,7.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ballast Stone Estate Wines
US,"This is one of the most beloved Chardonnays from Santa Barbara County, and for good reason: Bryan Babcock manages to imbue his wine with buttery richness yet also balance it with acidity and smoke. Honeysuckle, almond and Gravenstein apple aromas lead into energetic yet creamy marshmallow and poached pear flavors, all cut with citrusy acidity.",Top Cream Babcock Vineyard,93,45.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Babcock
Australia,"Like all of winemaker Kevin Mitchell's Shirazes, this is full-bodied and lushly textured. The point of difference here is the fruit character, which leans toward black olives and espresso, with just enough stewed fruit to provide cushioning. Finishes long and velvety, hinting at vanilla. Drink now–2012.",Covenant,92,40.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Shiraz,Kilikanoon
US,"Made in the popular style, with rich, ripe pineapple jam and kiwi fruit flavors enhanced with the sweet vanillins of oak. A good Chardonnay at a fair price.",,84,14.0,California,California,California Other,Chardonnay,Murphy-Goode
US,"With a mere 13.3% alcohol by volume, this wine represents Randall Grahm's efforts to get back to his interpretation of more balanced wines. What you get is elegance and fine structure, at the cost of richness. Totally dry, it shows cherry fruit, anise and pepper flavors, with a cherryskin tannic bitterness.",Alamo Creek,88,35.0,California,San Luis Obispo County,Central Coast,Syrah,Bonny Doon
US,"The winery's Saralee's bottling has been variable over the years. The '06 is tasty and eminently drinkable if you want a nice, dry, crisp Pinot. It's pale in color, silky in the mouth, and direct in cherry, cola, spice and oaky flavors. Drink now.",Saralee's Vineyard,87,42.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
US,"This shows the two classic markers of this vineyard: brisk, mouthwatering acidity and superripe flavors. The orange and peach notes meld with an apricot tone, which may have a touch of botrytis, lending a hint of honey. For all the richness, it's bone dry and minerally. Lovely now, but these Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Chardonnays age interestingly, gradually losing fruit and gaining nut and earthy notes.",Sleepy Hollow Vineyard,89,33.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Joullian
US,"You can smell the cherries in this Syrah and Grenache blend as soon as you pop the cork. Vibrant in red cherry, strawberry, raspberry, rose petal and vanilla flavors, it's bone dry and crisp. This blush wine shows real class.",Rosé de Saignee,87,22.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Rosé,Marilyn Remark
US,"With alcohol of just 12% the suspicion is that this wine has significant residual sugar; but once you taste it, you realize it's actually finished dry. Despite the delicate fruit flavors—melon and white grape—it does not seem underripe; it's quite Euro in style, and delightful as an apéritif.",,86,12.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris,Airlie
Italy,"Intense, generous aromas of white flower, passion fruit, citrus blossom and crushed stone comprise the nose. This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay offers impressive intensity and a long, spicy finish.",Paleo,92,75.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,White Blend,Le Macchiole
US,"Clear and light in color and texture, this offers an inviting floral and citrus bouquet, while the palate flirts with Asian five-spice and black cherry. While the fruit is compelling, the structure is undefined and the finish a tad flat.",White Label,85,49.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roadhouse Winery
US,"Very similar to the 2006, Kameron's '07 Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is upfront in blackberry, cherry, cassis, oak and spice flavors. It's quite tannic, with a puckery astringency that suggests needed time in the cellar. Better after 2014.",Cuvée Kristin Estate Blend,91,55.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Korbin Kameron
Portugal,"A rich wine, spiced with wood, tannins and sweet, ripe, black plums. The tannins give a granite, mineral edge of dryness, a core of strength in this impressive, structured wine. Wait another year for the black fruits to show through even more strongly.",,90,,Dão,,,Portuguese Red,Alvaro Castro
Spain,"Smooth and full of apple flavors and aromas. Runs a bit sweet and easy, with pear notes poking through. Finishes mild enough, with lemon-lime and a hint of mineral and toast. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Brut,86,13.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,1+1=3
US,"There's a good wine in here, but it needs some time to escape the cage of hard tannins and primary fruit. Floods the mouth with blackberry pie, crème de cassis and sweet, vanilla oak flavors that are just itching for a good 5–7 years in the cellar.",The Empress,90,75.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bugay
Spain,"Unusual in that this cava hails from the Ribera del Duero region, where red wines are 99.9% of the show. For a no-dosage nature, it's properly crisp and dry, almost like a liquid version of a soda cracker. There are some holes in the fabric but overall it's citrusy, tight and only mildly bitter on the finish.",Peñalba López Brut Nature,85,16.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Finca Torremilanos
US,"In this newest vintage of Oriana, the Riesling component has been bumped up to 18%; the rest is half Viognier, 31% Roussanne. The three grapes complement each other well; the Riesling adding aromatics, acidity and a barely perceptible amount of residual sugar. This opens with a vitamin pill aroma that slowly dissipates; the fruit flavors are a mix of pineapple and Satsuma orange, with lots of natural acidity.",Oriana White,90,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,White Blend,Brian Carter Cellars
Italy,"Founded in 1918 by one of the grandfathers and custodians of Barolo tradition, this historic estate is now run by Bartolo's energetic daughter Maria Teresa. She continues in a tradition of excellence, which highlights integrity of fruit and intensity of flavors. There's beautiful purity here in the form of cassis fruit, cherry cola and smoked Spanish cedar. Drink after 2017.",,95,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Cantina Bartolo Mascarello
Italy,"Perticaia delivers a gorgeous Trebbiano with rich creaminess to its texture and compelling aromas of passion fruit, melon, yellow rose and pulpy stone fruit. You could pair this beautiful wine with shellfish or crab cakes.",,89,,Central Italy,Umbria,,Trebbiano,Perticaia
France,"Floral wine, light in structure with some freshness. It's attractive, open, the tannins giving shape rather than aging potential.",,87,,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Les Carmes Haut-Brion
